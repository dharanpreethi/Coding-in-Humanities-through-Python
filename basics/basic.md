Basic Python
=======================

Hello, and welcome to Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to
Python 3. I hope you’re ready to learn why so many professional and
hobbyist developers are drawn to Python and how you can begin
using it on your own projects, small and large, right away.
This book is targeted at beginners who either know a little programming but not the Python language and ecosystem or are starting fresh
with no programming experience whatsoever.
If you don’t have a computer science degree, don’t worry. David, Dan,
Joanna, and Fletcher will guide you through the important computing concepts while teaching you the Python basics and, just as importantly, skipping the unnecessary details at first.

A few trivial lines can unleash incredible power. Because Python has access
to so many powerful but well-packaged libraries, such as requests, it’s
often described as having batteries included.
