## We Don’t Need You to Be a Computer Scientist
One other point that I want to emphasize as you start your Python
learning journey is that we don’t need you to be a computer scientist.
If that’s your goal, then great. Learning Python is a powerful step
in that direction. But the invitation to learn programming is often
framed as “We have all these developer jobs going unfilled! We need
software developers!”
That may or may not be true. But, more importantly, programming
(even a little programming) can be a personal superpower for you.
To illustrate this idea, suppose you are a biologist. Should you drop
out of biology and get a job as a front-end web developer? Probably
not. But skills such as the one I opened this foreword with, using requests to get data from the Web, can be incredibly powerful for you as
a biologist.
Rather than manually exporting and scraping data from the Web or
from spreadsheets, you can use Python to scrape thousands of data
sources or spreadsheets in the time it takes you to do just one manually. Python skills can take your biology power and amplify it well
beyond your colleagues’ to make it your superpower.
