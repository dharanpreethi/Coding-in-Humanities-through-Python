# # Regular Expression
# 
# * The expressions is a string of characters. 
# * There is 2 types of characters meta characters which have a special meaning & regular characters which have literal meaning.
# * Can be simple & easy to learn, however takes a long time to master & use advanced expressions
# 
# ![](images/reg.png)
# 
# ## How it Works?
# 
# * This is a few different algorithms that regular expressions can use.
# * The most common being a DFA or deterministic finite automation
# * The dfa algorithm is modified to use a pattern to specify its computation rules
# * The dfa algorithm takes o(2m) to construct the regular expressions( where m is the length of the regex pattern) the O(n) time to search of length n
# 
# ## Meta Characters
# 
# ![](images/meta.png)
# 
# ## Matching & searching
# 
# Python gives us 2 base methods to use our regular expressions with
# * Match() ==> checks to see if the expression matches the entire string
# * Search() ==> checks to see if there is a match anywhere string
# 
# ### A basic test of match & search
# * When constructing an expression we use a raw string to avoid problems with python
# * This is just an r before the string: râ€™pattern
