# # OOPS Concept
# ![](../images/oop.png)
# 
# Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
# 
# Class provides blueprints for objects.
# 
# The basic concept of OOPs is to create objects, re-use them throughout the program, and manipulate these objects to get results.
# 
# Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPs) is a programming concept that works on the principles of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
# 
# An object in OOPS is a specimen of a class. Software objects are often used to model real-world objects you find in everyday life.
