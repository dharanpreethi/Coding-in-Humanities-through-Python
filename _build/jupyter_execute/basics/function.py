# 
# * A function in a programming language is a program fragment that 'knows' how to perform a defined task. 
# * For example a function may be written that finds the average of three supplied numbers. 
# * Once written, this function may be used many times without having to rewrite it over and over.
# * Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task.
# * Functions usually "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over and over again. 
# * Functions can be "called" from the inside of other functions.
