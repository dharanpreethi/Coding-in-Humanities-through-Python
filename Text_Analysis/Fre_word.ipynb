      "destitute again, and forced to return to you and my poor mother, who\n",
      "have enough to do to maintain yourselves; and, as my lady's goodness\n",
      "had put me to write and cast accounts, and made me a little expert at my\n",
      "needle, and otherwise qualified above my degree, it was not every family\n",
      "that could have found a place that your poor Pamela was fit for: but\n",
      "God, whose graciousness to us we have so often experienced at a pinch,\n",
      "put it into my good lady's heart, on her death-bed, just an hour before\n",

      "one; and when it came to my turn to be recommended, (for I was sobbing\n",

      "your honour forgive me!--Yet I know not for what: for he was always\n",
      "dutiful to his parents; and why should he be angry that I was so to\n",
      "mine? And indeed he was not angry; for he took me by the hand, and said,\n",

      "though you ought to be wary what tales you send out of a family.--Be\n",
      "faithful and diligent; and do as you should do, and I like you the\n",
      "better for this. And then he said, Why, Pamela, you write a very pretty\n",
      "hand, and spell tolerably too. I see my good mother's care in your\n",
      "learning has not been thrown away upon you. She used to say you loved\n",

      "trouble is, and indeed a very great one, for fear you should be brought\n",
      "to anything dishonest or wicked, by being set so above yourself. Every\n",
      "body talks how you have come on, and what a genteel girl you are; and\n",
      "some say you are very pretty; and, indeed, six months since, when I saw\n",

      "what avails all this, if you are to be ruined and undone!--Indeed, my\n",
      "dear Pamela, we begin to be in great fear for you; for what signify all\n",

      "hereafter, if we continue to be good, though our lot is hard here; but\n",

      "her. She came to me: I was ready to go with my feet; but my heart\n",

      "happiness. I went up, however.\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis, said he, here you are both together. Do you sit down; but\n",

      "one against the other. Did you not think, when you saw the girl in the\n",

      "my reputation might have suffered in your opinion, and in that of all\n",

      "\n",
      "She was a little too much frightened, as she owned afterwards, at his\n",

      "honour's degree demeans himself to be so free as that to such a poor\n",
      "servant as me, what is the next to be expected?--But your honour went\n",
      "farther, so you did; and threatened me what you would do, and talked of\n",
      "Lucretia, and her hard fate.--Your honour knows you went too far for a\n",
      "master to a servant, or even to his equal; and I cannot bear it. So I\n",
      "fell a crying most sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis began to excuse me, and to beg he would pity a poor maiden,\n",
      "that had such a value for her reputation. He said, I speak it to her\n",
      "face, I think her very pretty, and I thought her humble, and one that\n",
      "would not grow upon my favours, or the notice I took of her; but I abhor\n",
      "the thoughts of forcing her to any thing. I know myself better, said he,\n",
      "and what belongs to me: And to be sure I have enough demeaned myself to\n",
      "take notice of such a one as she; but I was bewitched by her, I think,\n",
      "to be freer than became me; though I had no intention to carry the jest\n",
      "farther.\n",
      "\n",
      "What poor stuff was all this, my dear mother, from a man of his sense!\n",

      "fortune, and weak mind, has many advantages over guilt, with all its\n",
      "riches and wisdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I said, Your honour may call this jest or sport, or what you please;\n",
      "but indeed, sir, it is not a jest that becomes the distance between a\n",
      "master and a servant. Do you hear, Mrs. Jervis? said he: do you hear the\n",
      "pertness of the creature? I had a good deal of this sort before in the\n",
      "summer-house, and yesterday too, which made me rougher with her than\n",
      "perhaps I had otherwise been.\n",
      "\n",
      "Says Mrs. Jervis, Pamela, don't be so pert to his honour: you should\n",
      "know your distance; you see his honour was only in jest.--O dear Mrs.\n",
      "Jervis, said I, don't you blame me too. It is very difficult to\n",
      "keep one's distance to the greatest of men, when they won't keep it\n",
      "themselves to their meanest servants.\n",
      "\n",
      "See again! said he; could you believe this of the young baggage, if you\n",
      "had not heard it? Good your honour, said the well-meaning gentlewoman,\n",
      "pity and forgive the poor girl; she is but a girl, and her virtue is\n",
      "very dear to her; and I will pawn my life for her, she will never be\n",
      "pert to your honour, if you'll be so good as to molest her no more, nor\n",
      "frighten her again. You saw, sir, by her fit, she was in terror; she\n",
      "could not help it; and though your honour intended her no harm, yet the\n",
      "apprehension was almost death to her: and I had much ado to bring her to\n",
      "herself again. O the little hypocrite! said he; she has all the arts of\n",
      "her sex; they were born with her; and I told you awhile ago you did\n",
      "not know her. But this was not the reason principally of my calling you\n",
      "before me together. I find I am likely to suffer in my reputation by the\n",
      "perverseness and folly of this girl. She has told you all, and perhaps\n",
      "more than all; nay, I make no doubt of it; and she has written letters\n",
      "(for I find she is a mighty letter-writer!) to her father and mother,\n",
      "and others, as far as I know, in which representing herself as an\n",
      "angel of light, she makes her kind master and benefactor, a devil\n",
      "incarnate--(O how people will sometimes, thought I, call themselves by\n",
      "their right names!)--And all this, added he, I won't hear; and so I am\n",
      "resolved she shall return to the distresses and poverty she was taken\n",
      "from; and let her be careful how she uses my name with freedom, when she\n",
      "is gone from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was brightened up at once with these welcome words, and I threw myself\n",
      "upon my knees at his feet, with a most sincere glad heart; and I said,\n",
      "May your honour be for ever blessed for your resolution! Now I shall\n",
      "be happy. And permit me, on my bended knees, to thank you for all the\n",
      "benefits and favours you have heaped upon me; for the opportunities I\n",
      "have had of improvement and learning, through my good lady's means, and\n",
      "yours. I will now forget all your honour has offered me: and I promise\n",
      "you, that I will never let your name pass my lips, but with reverence\n",
      "and gratitude: and so God Almighty bless your honour, for ever and ever!\n",
      "Amen.\n",

      "when I bid you! and snatched my hand. I trembled, and said, I will! I\n",
      "will! for he hurt my fingers, he grasped me so hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed to have a mind to say something to me; but broke off abruptly,\n",
      "and said, Begone! And away I tripped as fast as I could: and he and\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis had a deal of talk, as she told me; and among the rest, he\n",
      "expressed himself vexed to have spoken in Mr. Jonathan's hearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now you must know, that Mr. Jonathan, our butler, is a very grave good\n",
      "sort of old man, with his hair as white as silver! and an honest worthy\n",
      "man he is. I was hurrying out with a flea in my ear, as the saying is,\n",
      "and going down stairs into the parlour, met him. He took hold of my\n",
      "hand (in a gentler manner, though, than my master) with both his; and he\n",
      "said, Ah! sweet, sweet Mrs. Pamela! what is it I heard but just now!--I\n",
      "am sorry at my heart; but I am sure I will sooner believe any body in\n",
      "fault than you. Thank you, Mr. Jonathan, said I; but as you value your\n",
      "place, don't be seen speaking to such a one as me. I cried too; and\n",
      "slipt away as fast as I could from him, for his own sake, lest he should\n",
      "be seen to pity me.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now I will give you an instance how much I am in Mr. Longman's\n",
      "esteem also.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had lost my pen some how; and my paper being written out, I stepped\n",
      "to Mr. Longman's, our steward's, office, to beg him to give me a pen\n",
      "or two, and a sheet or two of paper. He said, Ay, that I will, my sweet\n",
      "maiden! and gave me three pens, some wafers, a stick of wax, and twelve\n",
      "sheets of paper; and coming from his desk, where he was writing, he\n",
      "said, Let me have a word or two with you, my sweet little mistress: (for\n",
      "so these two good old gentlemen often call me; for I believe they love\n",
      "me dearly:) I hear bad news; that we are going to lose you: I hope it\n",
      "is not true. Yes it is, sir, said I; but I was in hopes it would not be\n",
      "known till I went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a d---l, said he, ails our master of late! I never saw such an\n",
      "alteration in any man in my life! He is pleased with nobody as I see;\n",
      "and by what Mr. Jonathan tells me just now, he was quite out of the way\n",
      "with you. What could you have done to him, tro'? Only Mrs. Jervis is a\n",
      "very good woman, or I should have feared she had been your enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, said I, nothing like it. Mrs. Jervis is a just good woman; and,\n",
      "next to my father and mother, the best friend I have in the world--Well,\n",
      "then, said he, it must be worse. Shall I guess? You are too pretty, my\n",
      "sweet mistress, and, may be, too virtuous. Ah! have I not hit it? No,\n",
      "good Mr. Longman, said I, don't think any thing amiss of my master; he\n",
      "is cross and angry with me indeed, that's true; but I may have given\n",
      "occasion for it, possibly; and because I am desirous to go to my father\n",
      "and mother, rather than stay here, perhaps he may think me ungrateful.\n",
      "But, you know, sir, said I, that a father and mother's comfort is the\n",
      "dearest thing to a good child that can be. Sweet excellence! said he,\n",
      "this becomes you; but I know the world and mankind too well; though I\n",
      "must hear, and see, and say nothing. And so a blessing attend my little\n",
      "sweeting, said he, wherever you go! And away went I with a courtesy and\n",
      "thanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this pleases one, my dear father and mother, to be so beloved.--How\n",

      "MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a great many neighbouring gentlemen, and their ladies, this day,\n",
      "at dinner; and my master made a fine entertainment for them: and Isaac,\n",
      "and Mr. Jonathan, and Benjamin, waited at table: And Isaac tells Mrs.\n",
      "Jervis, that the ladies will by and by come to see the house, and have\n",
      "the curiosity to see me; for, it seems, they said to my master, when\n",
      "the jokes flew about, Well, Mr. B----, we understand you have a\n",
      "servant-maid, who is the greatest beauty in the county; and we promise\n",
      "ourselves to see her before we go.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wench is well enough, said he; but no such beauty as you talk of,\n",
      "I'll assure ye. She was my mother's waiting-maid, who, on her death-bed,\n",
      "engaged me to be kind to her. She is young, and every thing is pretty\n",
      "that is young.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ay, ay, said one of the ladies, that's true; but if your mother had not\n",
      "recommended her so strongly, there is so much merit in beauty, that I\n",
      "make no doubt such a fine gentleman would have wanted no inducement to\n",
      "be kind to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all laughed at my master: And he, it seems, laughed for company;\n",
      "but said, I don't know how it is, but I see with different eyes from\n",
      "other people; for I have heard much more talk of her prettiness, than\n",
      "I think it deserves: She is well enough, as I said: but her greatest\n",
      "excellence is, that she is humble, and courteous, and faithful, and\n",
      "makes all her fellow-servants love her: My housekeeper, in particular,\n",
      "doats upon her; and you know, ladies, she is a woman of discernment:\n",
      "And, as for Mr. Longman, and Jonathan, here, if they thought themselves\n",
      "young enough, I am told, they would fight for her. Is it not true,\n",
      "Jonathan? Troth, sir, said he, an't please your honour, I never knew\n",
      "her peer, and all your honour's family are of the same mind. Do you hear\n",
      "now? said my master.--Well, said the ladies, we will make a visit to\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis by and by, and hope to see this paragon.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe they are coming; and will tell you the rest by and by. I wish\n",
      "they had come, and were gone. Why can't they make their game without me?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, these fine ladies have been here, and are gone back again. I would\n",
      "have been absent, if I could, and did step into the closet: so they saw\n",
      "me when they came in.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were four of them, Lady Arthur at the great white house on the\n",
      "hill, Lady Brooks, Lady Towers, and the other, it seems, a countess, of\n",
      "some hard name, I forget what.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Mrs. Jervis, says one of the ladies, how do you do? We are all come\n",
      "to inquire after your health. I am much obliged to your ladyships,\n",
      "said Mrs. Jervis: Will your ladyships please to sit down? But, said\n",
      "the countess, we are not only come to ask after Mrs. Jervis's health\n",
      "neither; but we are come to see a rarity besides. Ah, says Lady Arthur,\n",
      "I have not seen your Pamela these two years, and they tell me she is\n",
      "grown wondrous pretty in that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I wished I had not been in the closet; for when I came out, they\n",
      "must needs know I heard them; but I have often found, that bashful\n",
      "bodies owe themselves a spite, and frequently confound themselves more,\n",
      "by endeavouring to avoid confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, yes, says Mrs. Jervis, Pamela is very pretty indeed; she's but in\n",
      "the closet there:--Pamela, pray step hither. I came out all covered with\n",
      "blushes, and they smiled at one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "The countess took me by the hand: Why, indeed, she was pleased to say,\n",
      "report has not been too lavish, I'll assure you. Don't be ashamed,\n",
      "child; (and stared full in my face;) I wish I had just such a face to be\n",
      "ashamed of. O how like a fool I looked!\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Arthur said, Ay, my good Pamela, I say as her ladyship says: Don't\n",
      "be so confused; though, indeed, it becomes you too. I think your good\n",
      "lady departed made a sweet choice of such a pretty attendant. She would\n",
      "have been mighty proud of you, as she always was praising you, had she\n",
      "lived till now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah! madam, said Lady Brooks, do you think that so dutiful a son as our\n",
      "neighbour, who always admired what his mother loved, does not pride\n",
      "himself, for all what he said at table, in such a pretty maiden?\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked with such a malicious sneering countenance, I can't abide\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Towers said with a free air, (for it seems she is called a wit,)\n",
      "Well, Mrs. Pamela, I can't say I like you so well as these ladies do;\n",
      "for I should never care, if you were my servant, to have you and your\n",
      "master in the same house together. Then they all set up a great laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know what I could have said, if I durst. But they are ladies--and\n",
      "ladies may say any thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Says Lady Towers, Can the pretty image speak, Mrs. Jervis? I vow she has\n",
      "speaking eyes! O you little rogue, said she, and tapped me on the cheek,\n",
      "you seem born to undo, or to be undone!\n",
      "\n",
      "God forbid, and please your ladyship, said I, it should be either!--I\n",
      "beg, said I, to withdraw; for the sense I have of my unworthiness\n",
      "renders me unfit for such a presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then went away, with one of my best courtesies; and Lady Towers said,\n",
      "as I went out, Prettily said, I vow!--And Lady Brooks said, See that\n",
      "shape! I never saw such a face and shape in my life; why, she must be\n",
      "better descended than you have told me!\n",
      "\n",
      "And so they run on for half an hour more in my praises, as I was told;\n",
      "and glad was I, when I got out of the hearing of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, it seems, they went down with such a story to my master, and so\n",
      "full of me, that he had much ado to stand it; but as it was very little\n",
      "to my reputation, I am sure I could take no pride in it; and I feared\n",
      "it would make no better for me. This gives me another cause for wishing\n",
      "myself out of this house.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is Thursday morning, and next Thursday I hope to set out; for I\n",
      "have finished my task, and my master is horrid cross! And I am vexed\n",
      "his crossness affects me so. If ever he had any kindness towards me, I\n",
      "believe he now hates me heartily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it not strange, that love borders so much upon hate? But this wicked\n",
      "love is not like the true virtuous love, to be sure: that and hatred\n",
      "must be as far off, as light and darkness. And how must this hate have\n",
      "been increased, if he had met with such a base compliance, after his\n",
      "wicked will had been gratified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, one may see by a little, what a great deal means. For if innocence\n",
      "cannot attract common civility, what must guilt expect, when novelty\n",
      "has ceased to have its charms, and changeableness had taken place of it?\n",
      "Thus we read in Holy Writ, that wicked Amnon, when he had ruined poor\n",
      "Tamar, hated her more than he ever loved her, and would have turned her\n",
      "out of door.\n",
      "\n",
      "How happy am I, to be turned out of door, with that sweet companion my\n",
      "innocence!--O may that be always my companion! And while I presume not\n",
      "upon my own strength, and am willing to avoid the tempter, I hope the\n",
      "divine grace will assist me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forgive me, that I repeat in my letter part of my hourly prayer. I owe\n",
      "every thing, next to God's goodness, to your piety and good examples, my\n",
      "dear parents, my dear poor parents! I say that word with pleasure; for\n",
      "your poverty is my pride, as your integrity shall be my imitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as I have dined, I will put on my new clothes. I long to have\n",
      "them on. I know I shall surprise Mrs. Jervis with them; for she shan't\n",
      "see me till I am full dressed.--John is come back, and I'll soon send\n",
      "you some of what I have written.--I find he is going early in the\n",

      "hard if, some how or other, I can't get a passage to you. But may be\n",
      "my master won't refuse to let John bring me. I can ride behind him, I\n",
      "believe, well enough; for he is very careful, and very honest; and you\n",

      "I shall write on, as long as I stay, though I should have nothing but\n",

      "what I write, because it is mine. John tells me how much you long for\n",

      "I am glad you did not tell him the occasion of my coming away; for if\n",
      "my fellow-servants should guess, it were better so, than to have it from\n",
      "you or me. Besides, I really am concerned, that my master should\n",
      "cast away a thought upon such a poor creature as me; for, besides the\n",
      "disgrace, it has quite turned his temper; and I begin to believe what\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis told me, that he likes me, and can't help it; and yet\n",
      "strives to conquer it; and so finds no way but to be cross to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't think me presumptuous and conceited; for it is more my concern\n",
      "than my pride, to see such a gentleman so demean himself, and lessen\n",
      "the regard he used to have in the eyes of all his servants, on my\n",
      "account.--But I am to tell you of my new dress to day.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, when I had dined, up stairs I went, and locked myself into my\n",
      "little room. There I tricked myself up as well as I could in my new\n",
      "garb, and put on my round-eared ordinary cap; but with a green knot,\n",
      "however, and my homespun gown and petticoat, and plain leather shoes;\n",
      "but yet they are what they call Spanish leather; and my ordinary hose,\n",
      "ordinary I mean to what I have been lately used to; though I shall think\n",
      "good yarn may do very well for every day, when I come home. A plain\n",
      "muslin tucker I put on, and my black silk necklace, instead of the\n",
      "French necklace my lady gave me; and put the ear-rings out of my ears;\n",
      "and when I was quite equipped, I took my straw hat in my hand, with\n",
      "its two blue strings, and looked about me in the glass, as proud as any\n",
      "thing--To say truth, I never liked myself so well in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "O the pleasure of descending with ease, innocence, and\n",
      "resignation!--Indeed, there is nothing like it! An humble mind, I\n",
      "plainly see, cannot meet with any very shocking disappointment, let\n",
      "fortune's wheel turn round as it will.\n",

      "So I went down to look for Mrs. Jervis, to see how she liked me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I met, as I was upon the stairs, our Rachel, who is the house-maid; and\n",
      "she made me a low courtesy, and I found did not know me. So I smiled,\n",
      "and went to the housekeeper's parlour; and there sat good Mrs. Jervis at\n",
      "work, making a shift: and, would you believe it? she did not know me at\n",
      "first; but rose up, and pulled off her spectacles; and said, Do you want\n",
      "me, forsooth? I could not help laughing, and said, Hey-day! Mrs. Jervis,\n",
      "what! don't you know me?--She stood all in amaze, and looked at me\n",
      "from top to toe: Why, you surprise me, said she: What! Pamela thus\n",
      "metamorphosed! How came this about?\n",
      "\n",
      "As it happened, in stept my master; and my back being to him, he thought\n",
      "it was a stranger speaking to Mrs. Jervis, and withdrew again: and did\n",
      "not hear her ask, If his honour had any commands for her?--She turned me\n",
      "about and about, and I shewed her all my dress, to my under-petticoat:\n",
      "and she said, sitting down, Why, I am all in amaze, I must sit down.\n",
      "What can all this mean? I told her, I had no clothes suitable to my\n",
      "condition when I returned to my father's; and so it was better to begin\n",
      "here, as I was soon to go away, that all my fellow-servants might see I\n",
      "knew how to suit myself to the state I was returning to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said she, I never knew the like of thee. But this sad preparation\n",
      "for going away (for now I see you are quite in earnest) is what I know\n",
      "not how to get over. O my dear Pamela, how can I part with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "My master rung in the back-parlour, and so I withdrew, and Mrs. Jervis\n",
      "went to attend him. It seems, he said to her, I was coming in to let\n",
      "you know, that I shall go to Lincolnshire, and possibly to my sister\n",
      "Davers's, and be absent some weeks. But, pray, what pretty neat damsel\n",
      "was with you? She says, she smiled, and asked, If his honour did not\n",
      "know who it was? No, said he, I never saw her before. Farmer Nichols,\n",
      "or Farmer Brady, have neither of them such a tight prim lass for a\n",
      "daughter! have they?--Though I did not see her face neither, said he.\n",
      "If your honour won't be angry, said she, I will introduce her into your\n",
      "presence; for I think, says she, she outdoes our Pamela.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I did not thank her for this, as I told her afterwards, (for it\n",
      "brought a great deal of trouble upon me, as well as crossness, as you\n",
      "shall hear). That can't be, he was pleased to say. But if you can find\n",
      "an excuse for it, let her come in.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that she stept to me, and told me, I must go in with her to her\n",
      "master; but, said she, for goodness' sake, let him find you out; for he\n",
      "don't know you. O fie, Mrs. Jervis, said I, how could you serve me so?\n",
      "Besides, it looks too free both in me, and to him. I tell you, said she,\n",
      "you shall come in; and pray don't reveal yourself till he finds you out.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I went in, foolish as I was; though I must have been seen by him\n",
      "another time, if I had not then. And she would make me take my straw hat\n",
      "in my hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dropt a low courtesy, but said never a word. I dare say he knew me as\n",
      "soon as he saw my face: but was as cunning as Lucifer. He came up to me,\n",
      "and took me by the hand, and said, Whose pretty maiden are you?--I dare\n",
      "say you are Pamela's sister, you are so like her. So neat, so clean, so\n",
      "pretty! Why, child, you far surpass your sister Pamela!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was all confusion, and would have spoken: but he took me about the\n",
      "neck: Why, said he, you are very pretty, child: I would not be so free\n",
      "with your sister, you may believe; but I must kiss you.\n",
      "\n",
      "O sir, said I, I am Pamela, indeed I am: indeed I am Pamela, her own\n",
      "self!\n",
      "\n",
      "He kissed me for all I could do; and said, Impossible! you are a\n",
      "lovelier girl by half than Pamela; and sure I may be innocently free\n",
      "with you, though I would not do her so much favour.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a sad trick upon me, indeed, and what I could not expect; and\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis looked like a fool as much as I, for her officiousness.--At\n",
      "last I got away, and ran out of the parlour, most sadly vexed, as you\n",
      "may well think.\n",
      "\n",
      "He talked a good deal to Mrs. Jervis, and at last ordered me to come\n",
      "in to him. Come in, said he, you little villain!--for so he called me.\n",
      "(Good sirs! what a name was there!)--who is it you put your tricks upon?\n",

      "\n",

      "that was his word, do you mean then by this dress?--Why, and please your\n",
      "honour, said I, I mean one of the honestest things in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been in disguise, indeed, ever since my good lady your mother\n",

      "that these clothes I have on, are a princely suit to those I had then:\n",

      "I am now returning to my poor parents again so soon, I cannot wear those\n",

      "\n",
      "I thought he was mad, for my share; for he knew not what he would have.\n",
      "I was going, however; but he stept after me, and took hold of my arm,\n",
      "and brought me in again: I am sure he made my arm black and blue; for\n",
      "the marks are upon it still. Sir, sir, said I, pray have mercy; I will,\n",

      "\n",
      "He sat down, and looked at me, and, as I thought afterwards, as sillily\n",
      "as such a poor girl as I. At last he said, Well, Mrs. Jervis, as I was\n",
      "telling you, you may permit her to stay a little longer, till I see if\n",
      "my sister Davers will have her; if, mean time, she humble herself, and\n",
      "ask this as a favour, and is sorry for her pertness, and the liberty\n",
      "she has taken with my character out of the house, and in the house.\n",
      "Your honour indeed told me so, said Mrs. Jervis: but I never found her\n",
      "inclinable to think herself in a fault. Pride and perverseness, said he,\n",
      "with a vengeance! Yet this is your doating-piece!--Well, for once,\n",
      "I'll submit myself to tell you, hussy, said he to me, you may stay a\n",
      "fortnight longer, till I see my sister Davers: Do you hear what I say to\n",
      "you, statue? Can you neither speak nor be thankful?--Your honour frights\n",
      "me so, said I, that I can hardly speak: But I will venture to say,\n",
      "that I have only to beg, as a favour, that I may go to my father and\n",
      "mother.--Why fool, said he, won't you like to go to wait on my sister\n",
      "Davers? Sir, said I, I was once fond of that honour; but you were\n",
      "pleased to say, I might be in danger from her ladyship's nephew, or he\n",
      "from me.--D----d impertinence! said he; Do you hear, Mrs. Jervis, do you\n",
      "hear, how she retorts upon me? Was ever such matchless assurance!----\n",
      "\n",
      "I then fell a weeping; for Mrs. Jervis said, Fie, Pamela, fie!--And I\n",
      "said, My lot is very hard indeed; I am sure I would hurt nobody; and\n",
      "I have been, it seems, guilty of indiscretions, which have cost me my\n",
      "place, and my master's favour, and so have been turned away: and\n",
      "when the time is come, that I should return to my poor parents, I am not\n",
      "suffered to go quietly. Good your honour, what have I done, that I must\n",
      "be used worse than if I had robbed you?\n",

      "sir? said I; have I robbed you? Why then you are a justice of peace, and\n",
      "may send me to gaol, if you please, and bring me to a trial for my life!\n",

      "it was afterwards explained, neither: And well, thought I, what will\n",
      "this come to at last, if poor Pamela is esteemed a thief! Then I thought\n",
      "in an instant, how I should shew my face to my honest poor parents, if\n",
      "I was but suspected. But, sir, said I, let me ask you but one question,\n",
      "and pray don't let me be called names for it; for I don't mean\n",
      "disrespectfully: Why, if I have done amiss, am I not left to be\n",
      "discharged by your housekeeper, as the other maids have been? And if\n",
      "Jane, or Rachel, or Hannah, were to offend, would your honour stoop\n",
      "to take notice of them? And why should you so demean yourself to take\n",
      "notice of me? Pray, sir, if I have not been worse than others, why\n",
      "should I suffer more than others? and why should I not be turned away,\n",

      "\n",

      "the summer-house, and her dressing-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, this was a little saucy, you'll say--And he flew into such a\n",

      "one I hate to see or be seen by and indeed I hate now to see any body.\n",
      "Strange things I have to tell you, that happened since last night, that\n",

      "few books, and chest of drawers, and such like. I little suspected it;\n",
      "though I used, till this sad night, always to look into that closet\n",
      "and another in the room, and under the bed, ever since the summer-house\n",

      "fully resolved to be angry with Mrs. Jervis for what had happened in the\n",
      "day, and so thought of nothing else.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat myself down on one side of the bed, and she on the other, and we\n",

      "that held the worst heart in the world. So, said Mrs. Jervis, you won't\n",
      "speak to me, Pamela! I find you are angry with me. Why, Mrs. Jervis,\n",

      "pretending not to know me, on purpose to be free with me. And when he\n",
      "took upon himself to know me, to quarrel with me, and use me hardly: And\n",

      "\n",
      "Do you think, my dear, said she, that I would encourage him?--I never\n",

      "it is not in his power to help it.\n",

      "I luckily said nothing of the note from Mr. Jonathan; for I began to\n",

      "Davers now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, I'll tell you freely, my dear Pamela, said she, and I trust to your\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, said I, Mrs. Jervis, let me interrupt you: I will tell you why I\n",
      "could not think of that: It was not the pride of my heart, but the pride\n",
      "of my honesty: For what must have been the case? Here my master has been\n",
      "very rude to me, once and twice; and you say he cannot help it, though\n",
      "he pretends to be sorry for it: Well, he has given me warning to leave\n",
      "my place, and uses me very harshly; perhaps to frighten me to his\n",
      "purposes, as he supposes I would be fond of staying (as indeed I should,\n",
      "if I could be safe; for I love you and all the house, and value him, if\n",
      "he would act as my master). Well then, as I know his designs, and that\n",
      "he owns he cannot help it; must I have asked to stay, knowing he would\n",
      "attempt me again? for all you could assure me of, was, he would do\n",
      "nothing by force; so I, a poor weak girl, was to be left to my own\n",
      "strength! And was not this to allow him to tempt me, as one may say? and\n",
      "to encourage him to go on in his wicked devices?--How then, Mrs. Jervis,\n",
      "could I ask or wish to stay?\n",
      "\n",
      "You say well, my dear child, says she; and you have a justness of\n",
      "thought above your years; and for all these considerations, and for what\n",
      "I have heard this day, after you ran away, (and I am glad you went as\n",
      "you did,) I cannot persuade you to stay; and I shall be glad, (which\n",
      "is what I never thought I could have said,) that you were well at your\n",
      "father's; for if Lady Davers will entertain you, she may as well have\n",
      "you from thence as here. There's my good Mrs. Jervis! said I; God will\n",
      "bless you for your good counsel to a poor maiden, that is hard beset.\n",
      "But pray what did he say, when I was gone? Why, says she, he was very\n",
      "angry with you. But he would hear it! said I: I think it was a little\n",
      "bold; but then he provoked me to it. And had not my honesty been in the\n",
      "case, I would not by any means have been so saucy. Besides, Mrs.\n",
      "Jervis, consider it was the truth; if he does not love to hear of the\n",
      "summer-house, and the dressing-room, why should he not be ashamed to\n",
      "continue in the same mind? But, said she, when you had muttered this to\n",
      "yourself, you might have told him any thing else. Well, said I, I cannot\n",
      "tell a wilful lie, and so there's an end of it. But I find you now give\n",
      "him up, and think there's danger in staying.--Lord bless me! I wish I\n",
      "was well out of the house; so it was at the bottom of a wet ditch, on\n",
      "the wildest common in England.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, said she, it signifies nothing to tell you all he said but it was\n",
      "enough to make me fear you would not be so safe as I could wish;\n",
      "and, upon my word, Pamela, I don't wonder he loves you; for, without\n",
      "flattery, you are a charming girl! and I never saw you look more lovely\n",
      "in your life than in that same new dress of yours. And then it was such\n",
      "a surprise upon us all!--I believe truly, you owe some of your danger to\n",
      "the lovely appearance you made. Then, said I, I wish the clothes in the\n",
      "fire: I expected no effect from them; but, if any, a quite contrary one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hush! said I, Mrs. Jervis, did you not hear something stir in the\n",
      "closet? No, silly girl, said she, your fears are always awake.--But\n",
      "indeed, said I, I think I heard something rustle.--May be, says she, the\n",
      "cat may be got there: but I hear nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was hush; but she said, Pr'ythee, my good girl, make haste to bed. See\n",
      "if the door be fast. So I did, and was thinking to look into the closet;\n",
      "but, hearing no more noise, thought it needless, and so went again and\n",
      "sat myself down on the bed-side, and went on undressing myself. And\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis being by this time undressed, stepped into bed, and bid me\n",
      "hasten, for she was sleepy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know what was the matter, but my heart sadly misgave me: Indeed,\n",
      "Mr. Jonathan's note was enough to make it do so, with what Mrs. Jervis\n",
      "had said. I pulled off my stays, and my stockings, and all my clothes to\n",
      "an under-petticoat; and then hearing a rustling again in the closet, I\n",
      "said, Heaven protect us! but before I say my prayers, I must look into\n",
      "this closet. And so was going to it slip-shod, when, O dreadful! out\n",
      "rushed my master in a rich silk and silver morning gown.\n",
      "\n",
      "I screamed, and ran to the bed, and Mrs. Jervis screamed too; and he\n",
      "said, I'll do you no harm, if you forbear this noise; but otherwise take\n",
      "what follows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly he came to the bed (for I had crept into it, to Mrs. Jervis,\n",
      "with my coat on, and my shoes); and taking me in his arms, said, Mrs.\n",
      "Jervis, rise, and just step up stairs to keep the maids from coming down\n",
      "at this noise: I'll do no harm to this rebel.\n",
      "\n",
      "O, for Heaven's sake! for pity's sake! Mrs. Jervis, said I, if I am not\n",
      "betrayed, don't leave me; and, I beseech you, raise all the house. No,\n",
      "said Mrs. Jervis, I will not stir, my dear lamb; I will not leave you.\n",
      "I wonder at you, sir, said she; and kindly threw herself upon my coat,\n",
      "clasping me round the waist: You shall not hurt this innocent, said she:\n",
      "for I will lose my life in her defence. Are there not, said she, enough\n",
      "wicked ones in the world, for your base purpose, but you must attempt\n",
      "such a lamb as this?\n",
      "\n",
      "He was desperate angry, and threatened to throw her out of the window;\n",
      "and to turn her out of the house the next morning. You need not, sir,\n",
      "said she; for I will not stay in it. God defend my poor Pamela\n",
      "till to-morrow, and we will both go together.--Says he, let me but\n",
      "expostulate a word or two with you, Pamela. Pray, Pamela, said Mrs.\n",
      "Jervis, don't hear a word, except he leaves the bed, and goes to\n",
      "the other end of the room. Ay, out of the room, said I; expostulate\n",
      "to-morrow, if you must expostulate!\n",
      "\n",
      "I found his hand in my bosom; and when my fright let me know it, I was\n",
      "ready to die; and I sighed and screamed, and fainted away. And still he\n",
      "had his arms about my neck; and Mrs. Jervis was about my feet, and upon\n",
      "my coat. And all in a cold dewy sweat was I. Pamela! Pamela! said Mrs.\n",
      "Jervis, as she tells me since, O--h, and gave another shriek, my poor\n",
      "Pamela is dead for certain! And so, to be sure, I was for a time; for I\n",
      "knew nothing more of the matter, one fit following another, till about\n",
      "three hours after, as it proved to be, I found myself in bed, and Mrs.\n",
      "Jervis sitting upon one side, with her wrapper about her, and Rachel on\n",
      "the other; and no master, for the wicked wretch was gone. But I was so\n",
      "overjoyed, that I hardly could believe myself; and I said, which were my\n",
      "first words, Mrs. Jervis, Mrs. Rachel, can I be sure it is you? Tell\n",
      "me! can I?--Where have I been? Hush, my dear, said Mrs. Jervis; you have\n",
      "been in fit after fit. I never saw any body so frightful in my life!\n",
      "\n",
      "By this I judged Rachel knew nothing of the matter; and it seems my\n",
      "wicked master had, upon Mrs. Jervis's second noise on my fainting away,\n",
      "slipt out, and, as if he had come from his own chamber, disturbed by\n",
      "the screaming, went up to the maids' room, (who, hearing the noise, lay\n",
      "trembling, and afraid to stir,) and bid them go down, and see what was\n",
      "the matter with Mrs. Jervis and me. And he charged Mrs. Jervis, and\n",
      "promised to forgive her for what she had said and done, if she would\n",
      "conceal the matter. So the maids came down, and all went up again, when\n",
      "I came to myself a little, except Rachel, who staid to sit up with me,\n",
      "and bear Mrs. Jervis company. I believe they all guess the matter to be\n",
      "bad enough; though they dare not say any thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I think of my danger, and the freedoms he actually took, though I\n",
      "believe Mrs. Jervis saved me from worse, and she said she did, (though\n",
      "what can I think, who was in a fit, and knew nothing of the matter?) I\n",
      "am almost distracted.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first I was afraid of Mrs. Jervis; but I am fully satisfied she is\n",
      "very good, and I should have been lost but for her; and she takes on\n",
      "grievously about it. What would have become of me, had she gone out of\n",
      "the room, to still the maids, as he bid her! He'd certainly have shut\n",
      "her out, and then, mercy on me! what would have become of your poor\n",
      "Pamela?\n",
      "\n",
      "I must leave off a little; for my eyes and my head are sadly bad.--This\n",
      "was a dreadful trial! This was the worst of all! Oh, that I was out of\n",

      "\n",
      "I did not rise till ten o'clock, and I had all the concerns and wishes\n",
      "of the family, and multitudes of inquiries about me. My wicked master\n",
      "went out early to hunt; but left word he would be in to breakfast. And\n",
      "so he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came up to our chamber about eleven, and had nothing to do to be\n",
      "sorry; for he was our master, and so put on sharp anger at first.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had great emotions at his entering the room, and threw my apron over\n",
      "my head, and fell a crying, as if my heart would break.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis, said he, since I know you, and you me so well, I don't know\n",
      "how we shall live together for the future. Sir, said she, I will take\n",
      "the liberty to say, what I think is best for both. I have so much\n",
      "grief, that you should attempt to do any injury to this poor girl, and\n",
      "especially in my chamber, that I should think myself accessary to the\n",
      "mischief, if I was not to take notice of it. Though my ruin, therefore,\n",
      "may depend upon it, I desire not to stay; but pray let poor Pamela and\n",
      "me go together. With all my heart, said he; and the sooner the better.\n",
      "She fell a crying. I find, says he, this girl has made a party of the\n",
      "whole house in her favour against me. Her innocence deserves it of us\n",
      "all, said she very kindly: and I never could have thought that the son\n",
      "of my dear good lady departed, could have so forfeited his honour, as to\n",
      "endeavour to destroy a virtue he ought to protect. No more of this,\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis! said he; I will not hear it. As for Pamela, she has a lucky\n",
      "knack of falling into fits, when she pleases. But the cursed yellings\n",
      "of you both made me not myself. I intended no harm to her, as I told you\n",
      "both, if you'd have left your squallings: And I did no harm neither, but\n",
      "to myself; for I raised a hornet's nest about my ears, that, as far as I\n",
      "know, may have stung to death my reputation. Sir, said Mrs. Jervis, then\n",
      "I beg Mr. Longman may take my accounts, and I will go away as soon as\n",
      "I can. As for Pamela, she is at her liberty, I hope, to go away next\n",
      "Thursday, as she intends?\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat still; for I could not speak nor look up, and his presence\n",
      "discomposed me extremely; but I was sorry to hear myself the unhappy\n",
      "occasion of Mrs. Jervis's losing her place, and hope that may be still\n",
      "made up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said he, let Mr. Longman make up your accounts, as soon as you\n",
      "will; and Mrs. Jewkes (who is his housekeeper in Lincolnshire) shall\n",
      "come hither in your place, and won't be less obliging, I dare say, than\n",
      "you have been. Said she, I have never disobliged you till now; and let\n",
      "me tell you, sir, if you knew what belonged to your own reputation or\n",
      "honour--No more, no more, said he, of these antiquated topics. I have\n",
      "been no bad friend to you; and I shall always esteem you, though you\n",
      "have not been so faithful to my secrets as I could have wished, and have\n",
      "laid me open to this girl, which has made her more afraid of me than she\n",
      "had occasion. Well, sir, said she, after what passed yesterday, and last\n",
      "night, I think I went rather too far in favour of your injunctions\n",
      "than otherwise; and I should have deserved every body's censure, as the\n",
      "basest of creatures, had I been capable of contributing to your lawless\n",
      "attempts. Still, Mrs. Jervis, still reflecting upon me, and all for\n",
      "imaginary faults! for what harm have I done the girl?--I won't bear it,\n",
      "I'll assure you. But yet, in respect to my mother, I am willing to part\n",
      "friendly with you though you ought both of you to reflect on the freedom\n",
      "of your conversation, in relation to me; which I should have resented\n",
      "more than I do, but that I am conscious I had no business to demean\n",
      "myself so as to be in your closet, where I might have expected to hear a\n",
      "multitude of impertinence between you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, sir, said she, you have no objection, I hope, to Pamela's going\n",
      "away on Thursday next? You are mighty solicitous, said he, about Pamela:\n",
      "But no, not I; let her go as soon as she will: She is a naughty girl,\n",
      "and has brought all this upon herself; and upon me more trouble than she\n",
      "can have had from me: But I have overcome it all, and will never concern\n",
      "myself about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a proposal made me, added he, since I have been out this morning,\n",
      "that I shall go near to embrace; and so wish only, that a discreet use\n",
      "may be made of what is past; and there's an end of every thing with me,\n",
      "as to Pamela, I'll assure you. I clasped my hands together through my\n",
      "apron, overjoyed at this, though I was soon to go away: For, naughty as\n",
      "he has been to me, I wish his prosperity with all my heart, for my good\n",
      "old lady's sake. Well, Pamela, said he, you need not now be afraid to\n",
      "speak to me; tell me what you lifted up your hands at? I said not a\n",
      "word. Says he, If you like what I have said, give me your hand upon it.\n",
      "I held my hand up through my apron; for I could not speak to him; and he\n",
      "took hold of it, and pressed it, though less hard than he did my arm the\n",
      "day before. What does the little fool cover her face for? said he: Pull\n",
      "your apron away; and let me see how you look, after your freedom of\n",
      "speech of me last night. No wonder you are ashamed to see me. You know\n",
      "you were very free with my character.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not stand this barbarous insult, as I took it to be, considering\n",
      "his behaviour to me; and I then spoke and said, O the difference between\n",
      "the minds of thy creatures, good God! How shall some be cast down in\n",
      "their innocence, while others can triumph in their guilt!\n",
      "\n",
      "And so saying, I went up stairs to my chamber, and wrote all this; for\n",
      "though he vexed me at his taunting, yet I was pleased to hear he was\n",
      "likely to be married, and that his wicked intentions were so happily\n",
      "overcome as to me; and this made me a little easier. And I hope I have\n",
      "passed the worst; or else it is very hard. And yet I shan't think\n",
      "myself at ease quite, till I am with you: For, methinks, after all,\n",
      "his repentance and amendment are mighty suddenly resolved upon. But the\n",
      "divine grace is not confined to space; and remorse may, and I hope has,\n",
      "smitten him to the heart at once, for his injuries to poor me! Yet I\n",
      "won't be too secure neither.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having opportunity, I send now what I know will grieve you to the heart.\n",

      "you'll say: And, besides, I don't love to be beholden.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the chief reason I'm glad you don't set out to meet me, is the\n",
      "uncertainty; for it seems I must stay another week still, and hope\n",
      "certainly to go Thursday after. For poor Mrs. Jervis will go at the same\n",
      "time, she says, and can't be ready before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh! that I was once well with you!--Though he is very civil too at\n",
      "present, and not so cross as he was: and yet he is as vexatious another\n",
      "way, as you shall hear. For yesterday he had a rich suit of clothes\n",
      "brought home, which they call a birth-day suit; for he intends to go to\n",

      "\n",
      "And so, as I was saying, he had these clothes come home, and he tried\n",
      "them on. And before he pulled them off, he sent for me, when nobody else\n",
      "was in the parlour with him: Pamela, said he, you are so neat and so\n",
      "nice in your own dress, (Alack-a-day, I didn't know I was!) that you\n",
      "must be a judge of ours. How are these clothes made? Do they fit me?--I\n",

      "His waistcoat stood on end with silver lace, and he looked very grand.\n",

      "think every thing looks well upon you (for I still continue in my new\n",
      "dress). I said, I have no clothes, sir, I ought to call my own, but\n",
      "these: and it is no matter what such an one as I wears. Said he, Why you\n",
      "look very serious, Pamela. I see you can bear malice.--Yes, so I can,\n",
      "sir, said I, according to the occasion! Why, said he, your eyes always\n",
      "look red, I think. Are you not a fool to take my last freedom so much to\n",

      "hideous squalling, as much as I could frighten you. That is all we\n",
      "had for it, said I; and if you could be so afraid of your own servants\n",

      "work, as you must if you go to your father's; and so I would advise her\n",
      "to take a house in London, and let lodgings to us members of parliament,\n",

      "the tears gushed out, and (endeavouring to get my hand from him, but in\n",
      "vain) I said, I can expect no better: Your behaviour, sir, to me, has\n",
      "been just of a piece with these words: Nay, I will say it, though you\n",
      "were to be ever so angry.--I angry, Pamela? No, no, said he, I have\n",
      "overcome all that; and as you are to go away, I look upon you now as\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis's guest while you both stay, and not as my servant; and so\n",
      "you may say what you will. But I'll tell you, Pamela, why you need not\n",
      "take this matter in such high disdain!--You have a very pretty romantic\n",
      "turn for virtue, and all that.--And I don't suppose but you'll hold\n",
      "it still: and nobody will be able to prevail upon you. But, my child,\n",
      "(sneeringly he spoke it,) do but consider what a fine opportunity you\n",
      "will then have for a tale every day to good mother Jervis, and what\n",
      "subjects for letter-writing to your father and mother, and what pretty\n",
      "preachments you may hold forth to the young gentlemen. Ad's my heart! I\n",
      "think it would be the best thing you and she could do.\n",
      "\n",
      "You do well, sir, said I, to even your wit to such a poor maiden as me:\n",
      "but, permit me to say, that if you was not rich and great, and I poor\n",
      "and little, you would not insult me thus.--Let me ask you, sir, if you\n",
      "think this becomes your fine clothes, and a master's station: Why so\n",
      "serious, my pretty Pamela? said he: Why so grave? And would kiss me; but\n",
      "my heart was full, and I said, Let me alone; I will tell you, if you was\n",
      "a king, and insulted me as you have done, that you have forgotten to\n",
      "act like a gentleman; and I won't stay to be used thus: I will go to the\n",
      "next farmer's, and there wait for Mrs. Jervis, if she must go: and I'd\n",
      "have you know, sir, that I can stoop to the ordinariest work of your\n",

      "ungentlemanly imputations.\n",
      "\n",

      "while I see you here, pray don't put on those dismal grave looks: Why,\n",
      "girl, you should forbear them, if it were but for your pride-sake; for\n",
      "the family will think you are grieving to leave the house. Then, sir,\n",
      "said I, I will try to convince them of the contrary, as well as your\n",
      "honour; for I will endeavour to be more cheerful while I stay, for that\n",
      "very reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, replied he, I will set this down by itself, as the first time that\n",
      "ever what I had advised had any weight with you. And I will add, said\n",
      "I, as the first advice you have given me of late, that was fit to be\n",
      "followed.--I wish said he, (I am almost ashamed to write it, impudent\n",
      "gentleman as he is!) I wish I had thee as quick another way, as thou art\n",
      "in thy repartees--And he laughed, and I snatched my hand from him, and I\n",
      "tripped away as fast as I could. Ah! thought I, married? I am sure it is\n",
      "time you were married, or, at this rate, no honest maiden ought to live\n",

      "he had an eye upon me in his mother's life-time; and he intended to let\n",
      "me know as much, by the bye, he told her! Here is shamelessness for you!\n",
      "Sure the world must be near at an end! for all the gentlemen about are\n",
      "as bad as he almost, as far as I can hear!--And see the fruits of\n",

      "lyings-in, it seems, in his house, in three months past; one by himself;\n",
      "and one by his coachman; and one by his woodman; and yet he has turned\n",
      "none of them away. Indeed, how can he, when they but follow his own vile\n",
      "example? There is he, and two or three more such as he, within ten miles\n",
      "of us, who keep company, and hunt with our fine master, truly; and I\n",
      "suppose he is never the better for their examples. But, Heaven bless me,\n",

      "daughter. But else--Mr. Longman, interrupting him, said, Good to Mrs.\n",
      "Pamela! Ay, sir, and so she is, to be sure! But every body must be good\n",
      "to her; for----\n",
      "\n",
      "He was going on: but my master said, No more, no more, Mr. Longman. I\n",
      "see old men are taken with pretty young girls, as well as other folks;\n",
      "and fair looks hide many a fault, where a person has the art to behave\n",
      "obligingly. Why, and please your honour, said Mr. Longman, every\n",
      "body--and was going on, I believe, to say something more in my praise,\n",
      "but he interrupted him, and said, Not a word more of this Pamela. I\n",
      "can't let her stay, I'll assure you; not only for her own freedom of\n",
      "speech, but her letter-writing of all the secrets of my family. Ay, said\n",
      "the good old man, I am sorry for that too! But, sir,--No more, I say,\n",
      "said my master; for my reputation is so well known, (mighty fine,\n",
      "thought I!) that I care not what any body writes or says of me: But to\n",
      "tell you the truth, (not that it need go further,) I think of changing\n",
      "my condition soon; and, you know, young ladies of birth and fortune will\n",
      "choose their own servants, and that's my chief reason why Pamela can't\n",
      "stay. As for the rest, said he, the girl is a good sort of body,\n",
      "take her altogether; though I must needs say, a little pert, since my\n",
      "mother's death, in her answers, and gives me two words for one; which I\n",
      "can't bear; nor is there reason I should, you know, Longman. No, to be\n",
      "sure, sir, said he: but 'tis strange, methinks, she should be so mild\n",
      "and meek to every one of us in the house, and forget herself so, where\n",
      "she should shew most respect! Very true, Mr. Longman, said he, but so it\n",
      "is, I'll assure you; and it was from her pertness, that Mrs. Jervis and\n",
      "I had the words: And I should mind it the less, but that the girl (there\n",
      "she stands, I say it to her face) has wit and sense above her years, and\n",
      "knows better.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was in great pain to say something, but yet I knew not what, before\n",
      "Mr. Longman; and Mrs. Jervis looked at me, and walked to the window to\n",
      "hide her concern for me. At last, I said, It is for you, sir, to say\n",
      "what you please; and for me only to say, God bless your honour!\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Mr. Longman faltered in his speech, and was ready to cry. Said my\n",
      "insulting master to me, Why, pr'ythee, Pamela, now, shew thyself as thou\n",
      "art, before Longman. Can'st not give him a specimen of that pertness\n",
      "which thou hast exercised upon me sometimes?\n",
      "\n",
      "Did he not, my dear father and mother, deserve all the truth to be told?\n",
      "Yet I overcame myself so far, as to say, Well, your honour may play upon\n",
      "a poor girl, that you know can answer you, but dare not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, pr'ythee now, insinuator, said he, say the worst you can before\n",
      "Longman and Mrs. Jervis. I challenge the utmost of thy impertinence:\n",
      "and as you are going away, and have the love of every body, I would be\n",
      "a little justified to my family, that you have no reason to complain\n",
      "of hardships from me, as I have pert saucy answers from you, besides\n",
      "exposing me by your letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surely, sir, said I, I am of no consequence equal to this, in your\n",
      "honour's family, that such a great gentleman as you, should need to\n",
      "justify yourself about me. I am glad Mrs. Jervis stays with your honour;\n",
      "and I know I have not deserved to stay: and, more than that, I don't\n",
      "desire to stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ads-bobbers! said Mr. Longman, and ran to me; don't say so, don't say\n",
      "so, dear Mrs. Pamela! We all love you dearly: and pray down of your\n",
      "knees, and ask his honour pardon, and we will all become pleaders in a\n",
      "body, and I, and Mrs. Jervis too, at the head of it, to beg his honour's\n",
      "pardon, and to continue you, at least, till his honour marries.--No, Mr.\n",
      "Longman, said I, I cannot ask; nor will I stay, if I might. All I desire\n",
      "is, to return to my poor father and mother: and though I love you all, I\n",
      "won't stay.--O well-a-day, well-a-day! said the good old man, I did not\n",
      "expect this!--When I had got matters thus far, and had made all up for\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis, I was in hopes to have got a double holiday of joy for all\n",
      "the family, in your pardon too. Well, said my master, this is a little\n",
      "specimen of what I told you, Longman. You see there's a spirit you did\n",
      "not expect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis told me after, that she could stay no longer, to hear me so\n",
      "hardly used; and must have spoken, had she staid, what would never have\n",
      "been forgiven her; so she went out. I looked after her to go too; but\n",
      "my master said, Come, Pamela, give another specimen, I desire you, to\n",
      "Longman I am sure you must, if you will but speak. Well, sir, said I,\n",
      "since it seems your greatness wants to be justified by my lowness, and\n",
      "I have no desire you should suffer in the sight of your family, I will\n",
      "say, on my bended knees, (and so I kneeled down,) that I have been a\n",
      "very faulty, and a very ungrateful creature to the best of masters: I\n",
      "have been very perverse and saucy; and have deserved nothing at your\n",
      "hands but to be turned out of your family with shame and disgrace. I,\n",
      "therefore, have nothing to say for myself, but that I am not worthy to\n",
      "stay, and so cannot wish to stay, and will not stay: And so God Almighty\n",
      "bless you, and you Mr. Longman, and good Mrs. Jervis, and every living\n",
      "soul of the family! and I will pray for you as long as I live!--And so\n",
      "I rose up, and was forced to lean upon my master's elbow-chair, or I\n",
      "should have sunk down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor old man wept more than I, and said, Ads-bobbers, was ever the\n",
      "like heard! 'Tis too much, too much; I can't bear it. As I hope to live,\n",
      "I am quite melted. Dear sir, forgive her! The poor thing prays for\n",
      "you; she prays for us all! She owns her fault; yet won't be forgiven! I\n",
      "profess I know not what to make of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master himself, hardened wretch as he was, seemed a little moved, and\n",
      "took his handkerchief out of his pocket, and walked to the window:\n",
      "What sort of a day is it? said he.--And then, getting a little more\n",
      "hard-heartedness, he said, Well, you may be gone from my presence, thou\n",
      "strange medley of inconsistence! but you shan't stay after your time in\n",
      "the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nay, pray, sir, pray, sir, said the good old man, relent a little.\n",
      "Ads-heartikins! you young gentlemen are made of iron and steel, I think;\n",
      "I'm sure, said he, my heart's turned into butter, and is running away\n",
      "at my eyes. I never felt the like before.--Said my master, with an\n",
      "imperious tone, Get out of my presence, hussy! I can't bear you in my\n",
      "sight. Sir, said I, I'm going as fast as I can.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, indeed, my dear father and mother, my head was so giddy, and my\n",
      "limbs trembled so, that I was forced to go holding by the wainscot all\n",
      "the way with both my hands, and thought I should not have got to the\n",
      "door: But when I did, as I hoped this would be my last interview with\n",
      "this terrible hard-hearted master, I turned about, and made a low\n",
      "courtesy, and said, God bless you, sir! God bless you, Mr. Longman!\n",
      "and I went into the lobby leading to the great hall, and dropt into the\n",
      "first chair; for I could get no farther a good while.\n",
      "\n",
      "I leave all these things to your reflection, my dear parents but I can\n",
      "write no more. My poor heart's almost broken! Indeed it is--O when shall\n",
      "I get away!--Send me, good God, in safety, once more to my poor father's\n",

      "MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n",
      "\n",
      "I must write on, though I shall come so soon; for now I have hardly any\n",
      "thing else to do. I have finished all that lay upon me, and only wait\n",
      "the good time of setting out. Mrs. Jervis said, I must be low in pocket,\n",
      "for what I had laid out; and so would have presented me with two\n",
      "guineas of her five; but I could not take them of her, because, poor\n",
      "gentlewoman, she pays old debts for her children, that were extravagant,\n",
      "and wants them herself. This, though, was very good in her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sorry I shall have but little to bring with me; but I know you\n",
      "won't, you are so good!--and I will work the harder, when I come home,\n",
      "if I can get a little plain-work, or any thing, to do. But all your\n",
      "neighbourhood is so poor, that I fear I shall want work, except, may\n",
      "be, dame Mumford can help me to something, from any good family she is\n",
      "acquainted with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, what a sad thing it is! I have been brought up wrong, as matters\n",
      "stand. For, you know, my good lady, now in heaven, loved singing and\n",
      "dancing; and, as she would have it, I had a voice, she made me learn\n",
      "both; and often and often has she made me sing her an innocent song, and\n",
      "a good psalm too, and dance before her. And I must learn to flower and\n",
      "draw too, and to work fine work with my needle; why, all this too I have\n",
      "got pretty tolerably at my finger's end, as they say; and she used to\n",
      "praise me, and was a good judge of such matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well now, what is all this to the purpose, as things have turned about?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, no more nor less, than that I am like the grasshopper in the fable,\n",
      "which I have read of in my lady's book, as follows:--[See the Aesop's\n",
      "Fables which have lately been selected and reformed from those of Sir R.\n",
      "L'Estrange, and the most eminent mythologists.]\n",
      "\n",
      "'As the ants were airing their provisions one winter, a hungry\n",
      "grasshopper (as suppose it was poor I) begged a charity of them. They\n",
      "told him, That he should have wrought in summer, if he would not\n",
      "have wanted in winter. Well, says the grasshopper, but I was not idle\n",
      "neither; for I sung out the whole season. Nay, then, said they, you'll\n",
      "e'en do well to make a merry year of it, and dance in winter to the time\n",
      "you sung in summer.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So I shall make a fine figure with my singing and my dancing, when I\n",
      "come home to you! Nay, I shall be unfit even for a May-day holiday-time;\n",
      "for these minuets, rigadoons, and French dances, that I have been\n",
      "practising, will make me but ill company for my milk-maid companions\n",
      "that are to be. To be sure I had better, as things stand, have learned\n",
      "to wash and scour, and brew and bake, and such like. Put I hope, if I\n",
      "can't get work, and can meet with a place, to learn these soon, if\n",
      "any body will have the goodness to bear with me till I am able: For,\n",
      "notwithstanding what my master says, I hope I have an humble and\n",
      "teachable mind; and, next to God's grace, that's all my comfort: for I\n",
      "shall think nothing too mean that is honest. It may be a little hard at\n",
      "first; but woe to my proud heart, if I find it so on trial; for I will\n",
      "make it bend to its condition, or break it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have read of a good bishop that was to be burnt for his religion; and\n",
      "he tried how he could bear it, by putting his fingers into the lighted\n",

      "I could not scour a pewter plate she had begun. I see I could do't by\n",
      "degrees: It only blistered my hand in two places.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the matter is, if I could get plain-work enough, I need not spoil\n",
      "my fingers. But if I can't, I hope to make my hands as red as a\n",
      "blood-pudding, and as hard as a beechen trencher, to accommodate them to\n",
      "my condition.--But I must break off; here's somebody coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tis only our Hannah with a message from Mrs. Jervis.--But, hold, here's\n",
      "somebody else. Well, it is only Rachel.\n",

      "I am as much frighted, as were the city mouse and the country mouse, in\n",
      "the same book of fables, at every thing that stirs. O! I have a power of\n",
      "these things to entertain you with in winter evenings, when I come home.\n",
      "If I can but get work, with a little time for reading, I hope we shall\n",
      "be very happy over our peat fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "What made me hint to you, that I should bring but little with me, is\n",
      "this:\n",
      "\n",
      "You must know, I did intend to do, as I have this afternoon: and that\n",
      "is, I took all my clothes, and all my linen, and I divided them into\n",
      "three parcels, as I had before told Mrs. Jervis I intended to do; and\n",
      "I said, It is now Monday, Mrs. Jervis, and I am to go away on Thursday\n",
      "morning betimes; so, though I know you don't doubt my honesty, I beg you\n",
      "will look over my poor matters, and let every one have what belongs to\n",
      "them; for, said I, you know I am resolved to take with me only what I\n",
      "can properly call my own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said she, (I did not know her drift then; to be sure she meant well;\n",
      "but I did not thank her for it, when I did know it,) Let your things be\n",
      "brought down in the green-room, and I will do any thing you will have me\n",
      "do.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all my heart, said I, green-room or any where; but I think you\n",
      "might step up, and see 'em as they lie.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I fetched 'em down, and laid them in three parcels, as before;\n",
      "and, when I had done, I went down to call her up to look at them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it seems, she had prepared my master for this scene, unknown to\n",
      "me; and in this green-room was a closet, with a sash-door, and a curtain\n",
      "before it; for there she puts her sweet-meats and such things; and\n",
      "she did it, it seems, to turn his heart, as knowing what I intended, I\n",
      "suppose that he should make me take the things; for, if he had, I should\n",
      "have made money of them, to help us when we got together; for, to be\n",
      "sure, I could never have appeared in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, as I was saying, he had got, unknown to me, into this closet; I\n",
      "suppose while I went to call Mrs. Jervis: and she since owned to me, it\n",
      "was at his desire, when she told him something of what I intended, or\n",
      "else she would not have done it: though I have reason, I am sure, to\n",
      "remember the last closet-work.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I said, when she came up, Here, Mrs. Jervis, is the first parcel;\n",
      "I will spread it all abroad. These are the things my good lady gave\n",
      "me.--In the first place, said I--and so I went on describing the clothes\n",
      "and linen my lady had given me, mingling blessings, as I proceeded,\n",
      "for her goodness to me; and when I had turned over that parcel, I said,\n",
      "Well, so much for the first parcel, Mrs. Jervis; that was my lady's\n",
      "gifts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I come to the presents of my dear virtuous master: Hey, you know\n",
      "closet for that! Mrs. Jervis. She laughed, and said, I never saw such a\n",
      "comical girl in my life! But go on. I will, Mrs. Jervis, said I, as soon\n",
      "as I have opened the bundle; for I was as brisk and as pert as could be,\n",
      "little thinking who heard me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now here, Mrs. Jervis, said I, are my ever worthy master's presents; and\n",
      "then I particularised all those in the second bundle.\n",
      "\n",
      "After which, I turned to my own, and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Mrs. Jervis, comes poor Pamela's bundle; and a little one it is to\n",
      "the others. First, here is a calico nightgown, that I used to wear o'\n",
      "mornings. 'Twill be rather too good for me when I get home; but I must\n",
      "have something. Then there is a quilted calamanco coat, and a pair of\n",
      "stockings I bought of the pedlar, and my straw-hat with blue strings;\n",
      "and a remnant of Scots cloth, which will make two shirts and two shifts,\n",
      "the same I have on, for my poor father and mother. And here are four\n",
      "other shifts, one the fellow to that I have on; another pretty good one,\n",
      "and the other two old fine ones, that will serve me to turn and wind\n",
      "with at home, for they are not worth leaving behind me; and here are two\n",
      "pair of shoes, I have taken the lace off, which I will burn, and may be\n",
      "will fetch me some little matter at a pinch, with an old silver buckle\n",
      "or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you laugh for, Mrs. Jervis? said I.--Why you are like an April\n",
      "day; you cry and laugh in a breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, let me see; ay, here is a cotton handkerchief I bought of the\n",
      "pedlar--there should be another somewhere. O, here it is! and here too\n",
      "are my new-bought knit mittens; and this is my new flannel coat, the\n",
      "fellow to that I have on and in this parcel, pinned together, are\n",
      "several pieces of printed calico, remnants of silks, and such like,\n",
      "that, if good luck should happen, and I should get work, would serve\n",
      "for robins and facings, and such like uses. And here too are a pair of\n",
      "pockets: they are too fine for me; but I have no worse. Bless me, said\n",
      "I, I did not think I had so many good things!\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Mrs. Jervis, said I, you have seen all my store, and I will now\n",
      "sit down, and tell you a piece of my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be brief then, said she, my good girl: for she was afraid, she said\n",
      "afterwards, that I should say too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why then the case is this: I am to enter upon a point of equity and\n",
      "conscience, Mrs. Jervis; and I must beg, if you love me, you'd let me\n",
      "have my own way. Those things there of my lady's, I can have no claim\n",
      "to, so as to take them away; for she gave them me, supposing I was to\n",
      "wear them in her service, and to do credit to her bountiful heart. But,\n",
      "since I am to be turned away, you know, I cannot wear them at my poor\n",
      "father's; for I should bring all the little village upon my back; and so\n",
      "I resolve not to have them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, Mrs. Jervis, said I, I have far less right to these of my worthy\n",
      "master's; for you see what was his intention in giving them to me. So\n",
      "they were to be the price of my shame, and if I could make use of them,\n",
      "I should think I should never prosper with them; and, besides, you know,\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis, if I would not do the good gentleman's work, why should\n",
      "I take his wages? So, in conscience, in honour, in every thing, I have\n",
      "nothing to say to thee, thou second wicked bundle!\n",
      "\n",
      "But, said I, cone to my arms, my dear third parcel, the companion of\n",
      "my poverty, and the witness of my honesty; and may I never deserve the\n",
      "least rag that is contained in thee, when I forfeit a title to that\n",
      "innocence, that I hope will ever be the pride of my life! and then I am\n",
      "sure it will be my highest comfort at my death, when all the riches and\n",
      "pomps of the world will be worse than the vilest rags that can be worn\n",
      "by beggars! And so I hugged my third bundle.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, said I, Mrs. Jervis, (and she wept to hear me,) one thing more I\n",
      "have to trouble you with, and that's all.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are four guineas, you know, that came out of my good lady's\n",
      "pocket, when she died; that, with some silver, my master gave me: Now\n",
      "these same four guineas I sent to my poor father and mother, and they\n",
      "have broken them; but would make them up, if I would: and if you think\n",
      "it should be so, it shall. But pray tell me honestly your mind: As to\n",
      "the three years before my lady's death, do you think, as I had no wages,\n",
      "I may be supposed to be quits?--By quits, I cannot mean that my poor\n",
      "services should be equal to my lady's goodness; for that's impossible.\n",
      "But as all her learning and education of me, as matters have turned,\n",
      "will be of little service to me now; for it had been better for me to\n",
      "have been brought up to hard labour, to be sure; for that I must turn\n",
      "to at last, if I can't get a place: (and you know, in places too, one is\n",
      "subject to such temptations as are dreadful to think of:) so, I say, by\n",
      "quits I only mean, as I return all the good things she gave me, whether\n",
      "I may not set my little services against my keeping; because, as I said,\n",
      "my learning is not now in the question; and I am sure my dear good lady\n",
      "would have thought so, had she lived; but that too is now out of the\n",
      "question. Well then, if so, I would ask, Whether, in above this year\n",
      "that I have lived with my master, as I am resolved to leave all his\n",
      "gifts behind me, I may not have earned, besides my keeping, these four\n",
      "guineas, and these poor clothes here upon my back, and in my third\n",
      "bundle? Now tell me your mind freely, without favour or affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! my dear girl, says she, you make me unable to speak to you at all:\n",
      "To be sure it will be the highest affront that can be offered, for you\n",
      "to leave any of these things behind you; and you must take all your\n",
      "bundles with you, or my master will never forgive you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, well, Mrs. Jervis, said I, I don't care; I have been too much used\n",
      "to be snubbed and hardly treated by my master, of late. I have done him\n",
      "no harm; and I shall always pray for him and wish him happy. But I don't\n",
      "deserve these things; I know I don't. Then, I can't wear them, if I\n",
      "should take them; so they can be of no use to me: And I trust I shall\n",
      "not want the poor pittance, that is all I desire to keep life and soul\n",
      "together. Bread and water I can live upon, Mrs. Jervis, with content.\n",
      "Water I shall get any where; and if I can't get me bread, I will live\n",
      "like a bird in winter upon hips and haws, and at other times upon\n",
      "pig-nuts and potatoes, or turnips, or any thing. So what occasion have I\n",
      "for these things?--But all I ask is about these four guineas, and if you\n",
      "think I need not return them, that is all I want to know.--To be sure,\n",
      "my dear, you need not, said she; you have well earned them by that\n",
      "waistcoat only. No, I think not so, in that only; but in the linen, and\n",
      "other things, do you think I have? Yes, yes, said she, and more. And my\n",
      "keeping allowed for, I mean, said I, and these poor clothes on my back,\n",
      "besides? Remember that, Mrs. Jervis. Yes, my dear odd-one, no doubt you\n",
      "have. Well then, said I, I am as happy as a princess. I am quite as rich\n",
      "as I wish to be: and once more, my dear third bundle, I will hug thee to\n",
      "my bosom. And I beg you'll say nothing of all this till I am gone, that\n",
      "my master mayn't be so angry, but that I may go in peace; for my heart,\n",
      "without other matters, will be ready to break to part with you all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Mrs. Jervis, said I, as to one matter more: and that is my master's\n",
      "last usage of me, before Mr. Longman.--Said she, Pr'ythee, dear Pamela,\n",
      "step to my chamber, and fetch me a paper I left on my table. I have\n",
      "something to shew you in it. I will, said I, and stepped down; but that\n",
      "was only a fetch, to take the orders of my master, I found. It seems he\n",
      "said, he thought two or three times to have burst out upon me; but he\n",
      "could not stand it, and wished I might not know he was there. But I\n",
      "tripped up again so nimbly, (for there was no paper,) that I just saw\n",
      "his back, as if coming out of that green-room, and going into the next\n",
      "to it, the first door that was open--I whipped in, and shut the door,\n",
      "and bolted it. O Mrs. Jervis! said I, what have you done by me?--I see\n",
      "I can't confide in any body. I am beset on all hands. Wretched, wretched\n",
      "Pamela, where shalt thou expect a friend, if Mrs. Jervis joins to betray\n",
      "thee thus? She made so many protestations, (telling me all, and that\n",
      "he owned I had made him wipe his eyes two or three times, and said she\n",
      "hoped it would have a good effect, and remembered me, that I had said\n",
      "nothing but what would rather move compassion than resentment,) that\n",
      "I forgave her. But O! that I was safe from this house! for never\n",
      "poor creature sure was so flustered as I have been so many months\n",
      "together;--I am called down from this most tedious scribble. I wonder\n",
      "what will next befall Your dutiful DAUGHTER.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis says, she is sure I shall have the chariot to carry me home\n",
      "to you. Though this will look too great for me, yet it will shew as if\n",
      "I was not turned away quite in disgrace. The travelling chariot is come\n",

      "your mother, who recommended me to you with her last words, to forgive\n",

      "me; and that my heart be not quite broken.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took me up, in a kinder manner than ever I had known; and he said,\n",
      "Shut the door, Pamela, and come to me in my closet: I want to have a\n",
      "little serious talk with you. How can I, sir, said I, how can I! and\n",
      "wrung my hands. O pray, sir, let me go out of your presence, I beseech\n",

      "confidence in me, said he: Surely you may, when I have spoken thus\n",
      "solemnly. So I crept towards him with trembling feet, and my heart\n",
      "throbbing through my handkerchief. Come in, said he, when I bid you. I\n",
      "did so. Pray, sir, said I, pity and spare me. I will, said he, as I hope\n",

      "ingratitude for the kindness I am going to express towards you. This a\n",

      "You have too much wit and good sense not to discover, that I, in spite\n",
      "of my heart, and all the pride of it, cannot but love you. Yes, look\n",
      "up to me, my sweet-faced girl! I must say I love you; and have put on a\n",

      "\n",
      "I was unable to speak; and he, seeing me too much oppressed with\n",
      "confusion to go on in that strain, said, Well, Pamela, let me know in\n",

      "Then I could speak a little; and with a down look, (and I felt my face\n",

      "if this can be done, let me know how; and all I can do with innocence\n",
      "shall be the study and practice of my life.--But, O! what can such a\n",
      "poor creature as I do, and do my duty?--Said he, I would have you stay a\n",
      "week or fortnight only, and behave yourself with kindness to me; I\n",
      "stoop to beg it of you, and you shall see all shall turn out beyond your\n",
      "expectation. I see, said he, you are going to answer otherwise than I\n",
      "would have you; and I begin to be vexed I should thus meanly sue; and so\n",
      "I will say, that your behaviour before honest Longman, when I used you\n",
      "as I did, and you could so well have vindicated yourself, has quite\n",
      "charmed me. And though I am not pleased with all you said yesterday,\n",
      "while I was in the closet, yet you have moved me more to admire you than\n",
      "before; and I am awakened to see more worthiness in you, than ever I\n",
      "saw in any lady in the world. All the servants, from the highest to the\n",
      "lowest, doat upon you, instead of envying you; and look upon you in so\n",
      "superior a light, as speaks what you ought to be. I have seen more\n",
      "of your letters than you imagine, (This surprised me!) and am quite\n",
      "overcome with your charming manner of writing, so free, so easy, and\n",
      "many of your sentiments so much above your years, and your sex; and all\n",
      "put together, makes me, as I tell you, love you to extravagance. Now,\n",
      "Pamela, when I have stooped to acknowledge all this, oblige me only\n",
      "to stay another week or fortnight, to give me time to bring about some\n",
      "certain affairs, and you shall see how much you may find your account in\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I trembled to find my poor heart giving way.--O good sir, said I, spare\n",
      "a poor girl that cannot look up to you, and speak. My heart is full;\n",
      "and why should you wish to undo me?--Only oblige me, said he, to stay a\n",
      "fortnight longer, and John shall carry word to your father, that I will\n",
      "see him in the time, either here, or at the Swan in his village. O sir,\n",
      "said I, my heart will burst; but, on my bended knees, I beg you to\n",
      "let me go to-morrow, as I designed: and don't offer to tempt a poor\n",
      "creature, whose whole will would be to do yours, if my virtue would\n",
      "permit!--I shall permit it, said he; for I intend no injury to you, God\n",

      "what has passed: How many ways are there to undo poor creatures! Good\n",
      "God, protect me this one time, and send me but to my dear father's\n",
      "cot in safety!--Strange, d----d fate! said he, that when I speak so\n",
      "solemnly, I can't be believed!--What should I believe, sir? said I, what\n",
      "can I believe? What have you said, but that I am to stay a fortnight\n",
      "longer? and what then is to become of me?--My pride of birth and fortune\n",
      "(d--n them both! said he, since they cannot obtain credit with you, but\n",
      "must add to your suspicions) will not let me descend all at once; and\n",
      "I ask you but a fortnight's stay, that, after this declaration, I may\n",
      "pacify those proud demands upon me.\n",
      "\n",
      "O how my heart throbbed! and I began (for I did not know what I did) to\n",
      "say the Lord's prayer. None of your beads to me Pamela! said he; thou\n",
      "art a perfect nun, I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I said aloud, with my eyes lifted up to heaven, Lead me not into\n",
      "temptation: but deliver me from evil, O my good God! He hugged me in his\n",
      "arms, and said, Well, my dear girl, then you stay this fortnight, and\n",
      "you shall see what I will do for you--I'll leave you a moment, and walk\n",
      "into the next room, to give you time to think of it, and to shew you I\n",
      "have no design upon you. Well, this, I thought, did not look amiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went out, and I was tortured with twenty different doubts in a\n",
      "minute; sometimes I thought that to stay a week or fortnight longer in\n",
      "this house to obey him, while Mrs. Jervis was with me, could do no great\n",
      "harm: But then, thought I, how do I know what I may be able to do? I\n",
      "have withstood his anger; but may I not relent at his kindness?--How\n",
      "shall I stand that.--Well, I hope, thought I, by the same protecting\n",
      "grace in which I will always confide!--But, then, what has he promised?\n",
      "Why, he will make my poor father and mother's life comfortable. O! said\n",
      "I to myself, that is a rich thought; but let me not dwell upon it, for\n",
      "fear I should indulge it to my ruin.--What can he do for me, poor girl\n",
      "as I am!--What can his greatness stoop to! He talks, thought I, of his\n",
      "pride of heart, and pride of condition; O these are in his head, and in\n",
      "his heart too, or he would not confess them to me at such an instant.\n",
      "Well then, thought I, this can be only to seduce me.--He has promised\n",
      "nothing.--But I am to see what he will do, if I stay a fortnight; and\n",
      "this fortnight, thought I again, is no such great matter; and I shall\n",
      "see in a few days how he carries it.--But then, when I again reflected\n",
      "upon this distance between him and me, and his now open declaration of\n",
      "love, as he called it; and that after this he would talk with me on that\n",
      "subject more plainly than ever, and I shall be less armed, may be,\n",
      "to withstand him; and then I bethought myself, why, if he meant no\n",
      "dishonour, he should not speak before Mrs. Jervis; and the odious\n",
      "frightful closet came again into my head, and my narrow escape upon it;\n",

      "to you, Mrs. Jervis, (for I desire not to see it; I have had trouble\n",
      "enough about her already,) be sure you send it by a man and horse the\n",
      "moment you receive it. To be sure I will, answered she. Thank your\n",
      "honour, said the good man: And then I must wait with as much patience as\n",

      "\n",
      "I tell you, said the gentleman, it must be her own fault if she don't\n",

      "that to your satisfaction. God bless your honour, said the poor man, as\n",
      "you say and mean truth! Amen, Amen, Goodman Andrews, said he: you see I\n",
      "am not afraid to say Amen. So, Mrs. Jervis, make the good man as welcome\n",
      "as you can; and let me have no uproar about the matter.\n",

      "not thy poor creatures to be tempted above what they can bear, I will\n",

      "the effects of my presumption and vanity, I shall be enabled to overcome\n",
      "them, and, in God's own good time, be delivered from them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus do I pray imperfectly, as I am forced by my distracting fears and\n",

      "you know, how can I reveal to you, the dreadful situation of your poor\n",
      "daughter! The unhappy Pamela may be undone (which God forbid, and sooner\n",
      "deprive me of life!) before you can know her hard lot!\n",
      "\n",
      "O the unparalleled wickedness, stratagems, and devices, of those who\n",
      "call themselves gentlemen, yet pervert the design of Providence, in\n",
      "giving them ample means to do good, to their own everlasting perdition,\n",
      "and the ruin of poor oppressed innocence!\n",

      "But now I will tell you what has befallen me; and yet, how shall you\n",

      "besides, I am watched in all my steps; and no doubt shall be, till my\n",
      "hard fate may ripen his wicked projects for my ruin. I will every day,\n",
      "however, write my sad state; and some way, perhaps, may be opened to\n",
      "send the melancholy scribble to you. But, alas! when you know it, what\n",
      "will it do but aggravate your troubles? For, O! what can the abject poor\n",
      "do against the mighty rich, when they are determined to oppress?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, but I must proceed to write what I had hoped to tell you in a few\n",
      "hours, when I believed I should receive your grateful blessings, on my\n",
      "return to you from so many hardships.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will begin with my account from the last letter I wrote you, in which\n",

      "opportunity; though, as I said, I know not how it can reach you.\n",
      "\n",
      "The long-hoped for Thursday morning came, when I was to set out. I had\n",
      "taken my leave of my fellow-servants overnight; and a mournful leave\n",
      "it was to us all: for men, as well as women servants, wept much to\n",
      "part with me; and, for my part, I was overwhelmed with tears, and the\n",
      "affecting instances of their esteem. They all would have made me little\n",
      "presents, as tokens of their love; but I would not take any thing from\n",
      "the lower servants, to be sure. But Mr. Longman would have me accept of\n",
      "several yards of Holland, and a silver snuff-box, and a gold ring, which\n",
      "he desired me to keep for his sake; and he wept over me; but said, I am\n",
      "sure so good a maiden God will bless; and though you return to your\n",
      "poor father again, and his low estate, yet Providence will find you out:\n",
      "Remember I tell you so; and one day, though I mayn't live to see it, you\n",
      "will be rewarded.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, O, dear Mr. Longman! you make me too rich, and too mody; and\n",
      "yet I must be a beggar before my time for I shall want often to be\n",
      "scribbling, (little thinking it would be my only employment so soon,)\n",
      "and I will beg you, sir, to favour me with some paper; and, as soon as I\n",
      "get home, I will write you a letter, to thank you for all your kindness\n",
      "to me; and a letter to good Mrs. Jervis too.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was lucky; for I should have had none else, but at the pleasure of\n",
      "my rough-natured governess, as I may call her; but now I can write to\n",
      "ease my mind, though I can't send it to you; and write what I please,\n",
      "for she knows not how well I am provided: for good Mr. Longman gave me\n",
      "above forty sheets of paper, and a dozen pens, and a little phial of\n",
      "ink; which last I wrapped in paper, and put in my pocket; and some wax\n",
      "and wafers.\n",
      "\n",
      "O dear sir, said I, you have set me up. How shall I requite you? He\n",
      "said, By a kiss, my fair mistress: And I gave it very willingly; for he\n",
      "is a good old man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel and Hannah cried sadly, when I took my leave; and Jane, who\n",
      "sometimes used to be a little crossish, and Cicely too, wept sadly, and\n",
      "said, they would pray for me; but poor Jane, I doubt, will forget that;\n",
      "for she seldom says her prayers for herself: More's the pity!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Arthur the gardener, our Robin the coachman, and Lincolnshire Robin\n",
      "too, who was to carry me, were very civil; and both had tears in their\n",
      "eyes; which I thought then very good-natured in Lincolnshire Robin,\n",
      "because he knew but little of me.--But since, I find he might well be\n",
      "concerned; for he had then his instructions, it seems, and knew how he\n",
      "was to be a means to entrap me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then our other three footmen, Harry, Isaac, and Benjamin, and grooms,\n",
      "and helpers, were very much affected likewise; and the poor little\n",
      "scullion-boy, Tommy, was ready to run over for grief.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had got all together over-night, expecting to be differently\n",
      "employed in the morning; and they all begged to shake hands with me, and\n",
      "I kissed the maidens, and prayed to God to bless them all; and thanked\n",
      "them for all their love and kindness to me: and, indeed, I was forced to\n",
      "leave them sooner than I would, because I could not stand it: Indeed\n",
      "I could not. Harry (I could not have thought it; for he is a little\n",
      "wildish, they say) cried till he sobbed again. John, poor honest John,\n",
      "was not then come back from you. But as for the butler, Mr. Jonathan, he\n",
      "could not stay in company.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought to have told you a deal about this; but I have worse things to\n",
      "employ my thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis, good Mrs. Jervis, cried all night long; and I comforted her\n",
      "all I could: And she made me promise, that if my master went to London\n",
      "to attend parliament, or to Lincolnshire, I would come and stay a week\n",
      "with her: and she would have given me money; but I would not take it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, next morning came, and I wondered I saw nothing of poor honest\n",
      "John; for I waited to take leave of him, and thank him for all his\n",
      "civilities to me and to you. But I suppose he was sent farther by my\n",
      "master, and so could not return; and I desired to be remembered to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when Mrs. Jervis told me, with a sad heart, the chariot was ready\n",
      "with four horses to it, I was just upon sinking into the ground, though\n",
      "I wanted to be with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master was above stairs, and never asked to see me. I was glad of it\n",
      "in the main; but he knew, false heart as he is, that I was not to be\n",
      "out of his reach.--O preserve me, Heaven, from his power, and from his\n",
      "wickedness!\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, they were not suffered to go with me one step, as I writ to you\n",
      "before; for he stood at the window to see me go. And in the passage to\n",
      "the gate, out of his sight, there they stood all of them, in two rows;\n",
      "and we could say nothing on both sides, but God bless you! and God bless\n",
      "you! But Harry carried my own bundle, my third bundle, as I was used to\n",
      "call it, to the coach, with some plumb-cake, and diet-bread, made for me\n",
      "over-night, and some sweet-meats, and six bottles of Canary wine, which\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis would make me take in a basket, to cheer our hearts now\n",
      "and then, when we got together, as she said. And I kissed all the maids\n",
      "again, and shook hands with the men again: but Mr. Jonathan and Mr.\n",
      "Longman were not there; and then I tripped down the steps to the\n",
      "chariot, Mrs. Jervis crying most sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked up when I got to the chariot, and I saw my master at the\n",
      "window, in his gown; and I courtesied three times to him very low, and\n",
      "prayed for him with my hands lifted up; for I could not speak; indeed I\n",
      "was not able: And he bowed his head to me, which made me then very glad\n",
      "he would take such notice of me; and in I stepped, and was ready to\n",
      "burst with grief; and could only, till Robin began to drive, wave my\n",
      "white handkerchief to them, wet with my tears: and, at last, away he\n",
      "drove, Jehu-like, as they say, out of the court-yard. And I too soon\n",
      "found I had cause for greater and deeper grief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said I to myself, at this rate I shall soon be with my dear father\n",
      "and mother; and till I had got, as I supposed, half-way, I thought of\n",
      "the good friends I had left: And when, on stopping for a little bait\n",
      "to the horses, Robin told me I was near half-way, I thought it was high\n",
      "time to wipe my eyes, and think to whom I was going; as then, alack for\n",
      "me! I thought. So I began to ponder what a meeting I should have with\n",
      "you; how glad you'd both be to see me come safe and innocent to you,\n",
      "after all my dangers: and so I began to comfort myself, and to banish\n",
      "the other gloomy side from my mind; though, too, it returned now and\n",
      "then; for I should be ungrateful not to love them for their love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I believe I set out about eight o'clock in the morning; and I\n",
      "wondered and wondered, when it was about two, as I saw by a church dial,\n",
      "in a little village as we passed through, that I was still more and more\n",
      "out of my knowledge. Hey-day, thought I, to drive this strange pace, and\n",
      "to be so long a going a little more than twenty miles, is very odd! But\n",
      "to be sure, thought I, Robin knows the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last he stopped, and looked about him, as if he was at a loss for the\n",
      "road; and I said, Mr. Robert, sure you are out of the way!--I'm afraid I\n",
      "am, said he. But it can't be much; I'll ask the first person I see. Pray\n",
      "do, said I; and he gave his horses a mouthful of bay: and I gave him\n",
      "some cake, and two glasses of Canary wine; and stopt about half an hour\n",
      "in all. Then he drove on very fast again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had so much to think of, of the dangers I now doubted not I had\n",
      "escaped, of the loving friends I had left, and my best friends I was\n",
      "going to; and the many things I had to relate to you; that I the less\n",
      "thought of the way, till I was startled out of my meditations by the sun\n",
      "beginning to set, and still the man driving on, and his horses sweating\n",
      "and foaming; and then I began to be alarmed all at once, and called to\n",
      "him; and he said he had horrid ill luck, for he had come several miles\n",
      "out of the way, but was now right, and should get in still before it was\n",
      "quite dark. My heart began then to misgive me a little, and I was very\n",
      "much fatigued; for I had no sleep for several nights before, to signify;\n",
      "and at last I said, Pray Mr. Robert, there is a town before us, what\n",
      "do you call it?--If we are so much out of the way, we had better put up\n",
      "there, for the night comes on apace: And, Lord protect me! thought I,\n",
      "I shall have new dangers, mayhap, to encounter with the man, who have\n",
      "escaped the master--little thinking of the base contrivance of the\n",
      "latter.--Says he, I am just there: 'Tis but a mile on one side of the\n",
      "town before us.--Nay, said I, I may be mistaken; for it is a good while\n",
      "since I was this way; but I am sure the face of the country here is\n",
      "nothing like what I remember it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He pretended to be much out of humour with himself for mistaking the\n",
      "way, and at last stopped at a farmhouse, about two miles beyond the\n",
      "village I had seen; and it was then almost dark, and he alighted, and\n",
      "said, We must make shift here; for I am quite out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord, thought I, be good to the poor Pamela! More trials still!--What\n",
      "will befall me next?\n",
      "\n",
      "The farmer's wife, and maid, and daughter, came out; and the wife said,\n",
      "What brings you this way at this time of night, Mr. Robert? And with\n",
      "a lady too?--Then I began to be frightened out of my wits; and laying\n",
      "middle and both ends together, I fell a crying, and said, God give me\n",
      "patience! I am undone for certain!--Pray, mistress, said I, do you know\n",
      "'Squire B----, of Bedfordshire?\n",
      "\n",
      "The wicked coachman would have prevented the answering me; but the\n",
      "simple daughter said, Know his worship! yes, surely! why he is my\n",
      "father's landlord.--Well, said I, then I am undone; undone for ever!--O,\n",
      "wicked wretch! what have I done to you, said I to the coachman, to serve\n",
      "me thus?--Vile tool of a wicked master!--Faith, said the fellow, I am\n",
      "sorry this task was put upon me; but I could not help it. But make the\n",
      "best of it now; here are very civil reputable folks; and you'll be safe\n",
      "here, I'll assure you.--Let me get out, said I, and I'll walk back to\n",
      "the town we came through, late as it is:--For I will not enter here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said the farmer's wife, You'll be very well used here, I'll assure you,\n",
      "young gentlewoman, and have better conveniences than any where in the\n",
      "village. I matter not conveniences, said I: I am betrayed and undone!\n",
      "As you have a daughter of your own, pity me, and let me know if your\n",
      "landlord, as you call him, be here!--No, I'll assure you he is not, said\n",
      "she.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then came the farmer, a good-like sort of man, grave, and\n",
      "well-behaved; and spoke to me in such sort, as made me a little\n",
      "pacified; and seeing no help for it, I went in; and the wife immediately\n",
      "conducted me up stairs to the best apartment, and told me, that was mine\n",
      "as long as I staid: and nobody should come near me but when I called.\n",
      "I threw myself on the bed in the room, tired and frightened to death\n",
      "almost; and gave way to the most excessive fit of grief that I ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "The daughter came up, and said, Mr. Robert had given her a letter to\n",
      "give me; and there it was. I raised myself, and saw it was the hand\n",
      "and seal of the wicked wretch, my master, directed to Mrs. Pamela\n",
      "Andrews.--This was a little better than to have him here; though, if he\n",
      "had, he must have been brought through the air; for I thought I was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good woman (for I began to see things about a little reputable, and\n",
      "no guile appearing in them, but rather a face of grief for my grief)\n",
      "offered me a glass of some cordial water, which I accepted, for I\n",
      "was ready to sink; and then I sat up in a chair a little, though very\n",
      "faintish: and they brought me two candles, and lighted a brushwood fire;\n",
      "and said, if I called, I should be waited on instantly; and so left me\n",
      "to ruminate on my sad condition, and to read my letter, which I was not\n",
      "able to do presently. After I had a little come to myself, I found it to\n",

      "Well, said I, you will not, I hope, do an unlawful or wicked thing, for\n",
      "any master in the world. Look ye, said she, he is my master; and if he\n",
      "bids me do any thing that I can do, I think I ought to do it; and let\n",
      "him, who has his power to command me, look to the lawfulness of it.\n",
      "Why, said I, suppose he should bid you cut my throat, Would you do it?\n",
      "There's no danger of that, said she; but to be sure I would not; for\n",
      "then I should be hanged! for that would be murder. Well, said I, and\n",
      "suppose he should resolve to ensnare a poor young creature, and ruin\n",
      "her, would you assist him in that? For to rob a person of her virtue is\n",
      "worse than cutting her throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why now, says she, how strangely you talk! Are not the two sexes made\n",
      "for one another? And is it not natural for a gentleman to love a pretty\n",
      "woman? And suppose he can obtain his desires, is that so bad as cutting\n",
      "her throat? And then the wretch fell a laughing, and talked most\n",
      "impertinently, and shewed me, that I had nothing to expect from her\n",
      "virtue or conscience: and this gave me great mortification; for I was in\n",
      "hopes of working upon her by degrees.\n",

      "wrung my heart!--But is it in your instructions, that you must lie with\n",
      "me? Yes, indeed, said she.--I am sorry for it, said I. Why, said she,\n",
      "I am wholesome, and cleanly too, I'll assure you. Yes, said I, I don't\n",
      "doubt that; but I love to lie by myself. How so? said she; Was not Mrs.\n",

      "What's that? what's that? said Mrs. Jewkes.--Only, said he, the town,\n",
      "I'm saying, is not very pleasant. No, indeed, said she, it is not; it is\n",
      "a poor town, to my thinking. Are there any gentry in it? said I. And so\n",
      "we chatted on about the town, to deceive her. But my deceit intended no\n",

      "\n",
      "We then talked of the garden, how large and pleasant, and the like; and\n",
      "sat down on the tufted slope of the fine fish-pond, to see the fishes\n",

      "I wish, said I, you'd be so kind to fetch me a rod and baits. Pretty\n",

      "time.--I mean no harm, said I, indeed. Let me tell you, said she. I know\n",
      "none who have their thoughts more about them than you. A body ought\n",
      "to look to it where you are. But we'll angle a little to-morrow. Mr.\n",
      "Williams, who is much afraid of her, turned the discourse to a general\n",

      "\n",
      "I had got to my pen and ink; and I said, I want some paper, Mrs. Jewkes,\n",

      "grieves me!) Well, said she, you have some left; one sheet did for those\n",
      "two letters. Yes, said I; but I used half another for a cover, you\n",
      "know; and see how I have scribbled the other half; and so I shewed her\n",
      "a parcel of broken scraps of verses, which I had tried to recollect, and\n",
      "had written purposely that she might see, and think me usually employed\n",
      "to such idle purposes. Ay, said she, so you have; well, I'll give you\n",
      "two sheets more; but let me see how you dispose of them, either written\n",
      "or blank. Well, thought I, I hope still, Argus, to be too hard for thee.\n",
      "Now Argus, the poets say, had a hundred eyes, and was set to watch with\n",

      "\n",
      "She brought me the paper, and said, Now, madam, let me see you write\n",

      "\n",
      "Thus I fooled on, to shew her my fondness for scribbling; for I had no\n",
      "expectation of any good from her; that so she might suppose I employed\n",
      "myself, as I said, to no better purpose at other times: for she will\n",
      "have it, that I am upon some plot, I am so silent, and love so much to\n",
      "be by myself.--She would have made me write on a little further. No,\n",
      "said I; you have not answered me. Why, said she, what can you doubt,\n",
      "when my master himself assures you of his honour? Ay, said I; but lay\n",
      "your hand to your heart, Mrs. Jewkes, and tell me, if you yourself\n",
      "believe him. Yes, said she, to be sure I do. But, said I, what do you\n",
      "call honour? Why, said she, what does he call honour, think you?--Ruin!\n",
      "shame! disgrace! said I, I fear.--Pho! pho! said she; if you have any\n",
      "doubt about it, he can best explain his own meaning:--I'll send him word\n",
      "to come and satisfy you, if you will.--Horrid creature! said I, all in a\n",
      "fright--Can'st thou not stab me to the heart? I'd rather thou would'st,\n",
      "than say such another word!--But I hope there is no such thought of his\n",
      "coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had the wickedness to say, No, no; he don't intend to come, as\n",
      "I know of--But if I was he, I would not be long away. What means the\n",
      "woman? said I.--Mean! said she, (turning it off;) why I mean, I would\n",
      "come, if I was he, and put an end to all your fears--by making you as\n",
      "happy as you wish. It is out of his power, said I, to make me happy,\n",
      "great and rich as he is! but by leaving me innocent, and giving me\n",
      "liberty to go to my dear father and mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went away soon after, and I ended my letter, in hopes to have an\n",
      "opportunity to lay it in the appointed place. So I went to her, and\n",
      "said; I suppose, as it is not dark, I may take another turn in the\n",
      "garden. It is too late, said she; but if you will go, don't stay; and,\n",
      "Nan, see and attend madam, as she called me.\n",

      "side. She went back to look, and I slipt the note between the tiles,\n",

      "unperceived; and the maid finding the hussy, I took it, and sauntered\n",

      "was ever the like heard? says she.--This is downright rebellion, I\n",
      "protest!--Well, well, lambkin, (which the foolish often calls me,) if\n",
      "I was in his place, he should not have his property in you long\n",
      "questionable. Why, what would you do, said I, if you were he?--Not stand\n",
      "shill-I-shall-I, as he does; but put you and himself both out of your\n",
      "pain.--Why, Jezebel, said I, (I could not help it,) would you ruin me by\n",

      "\n",
      "I did not know what to do. This was a cruel thing to me, and I blamed\n",

      "had left.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gardener saw this scene: but she called to him, Well, Jacob, what do\n",

      "quarter, out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, thought I, I must put on the dissembler a little, I see. She took\n",
      "my hand roughly; Come, get up, said she, and come in a'doors!--I'll\n",
      "Jezebel you, I will so!--Why, dear Mrs. Jewkes, said I.--None of your\n",
      "dears, and your coaxing! said she; why not Jezebel again?--She was in\n",
      "a fearful passion, I saw, and I was out of my wits. Thought I, I\n",
      "have often heard women blamed for their tongues; I wish mine had been\n",
      "shorter. But I can't go in, said I, indeed I can't!--Why, said she,\n",
      "can't you? I'll warrant I can take such a thin body as you under my arm,\n",
      "and carry you in, if you won't walk. You don't know my strength.--Yes,\n",
      "but I do, said I, too well; and will you not use me worse when I come\n",
      "in?--So I arose, and she muttered to herself all the way, She to be a\n",
      "Jezebel with me, that had used me so well! and such like.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I came near the house, I said, sitting down upon a settle-bench,\n",
      "Well, I will not go in, till you say you forgive me, Mrs. Jewkes.--If\n",
      "you will forgive my calling you that name, I will forgive your beating\n",
      "me.--She sat down by me, and seemed in a great pucker, and said, Well,\n",
      "come, I will forgive you for this time: and so kissed me, as a mark of\n",
      "reconciliation.--But pray, said I, tell me where I am to walk and go,\n",
      "and give me what liberty you can; and when I know the most you can\n",
      "favour me with, you shall see I will be as content as I can, and not ask\n",
      "you for more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ay, said she, this is something like: I wish I could give you all the\n",
      "liberty you desire; for you must think it is no pleasure to me to tie\n",
      "you to my petticoat, as it were, and not let you stir without me.--But\n",
      "people that will do their duties, must have some trouble: and what I\n",
      "do, is to serve as good a master, to be sure, as lives.--Yes, said I, to\n",
      "every body but me! He loves you too well, to be sure, returned she;\n",

      "well. But if any thing should go bad afterwards, I should never forgive\n",
      "myself, for not taking this opportunity. Well, I will go down again,\n",

      "To be sure, there is witchcraft in this house; and I believe Lucifer is\n",
      "bribed, as well as all about me, and is got into the shape of that nasty\n",
      "grim bull to watch me!--For I have been again, and ventured to open the\n",
      "door, and went out about a bow-shot into the pasture; but there stood\n",
      "that horrid bull, staring me full in the face, with fiery saucer eyes,\n",
      "as I thought. So I got in again, for fear he should come at me. Nobody\n",
      "saw me, however.--Do you think there are such things as witches and\n",
      "spirits? If there be, I believe, in my heart, Mrs. Jewkes has got\n",
      "this bull of her side. But yet, what could I do without money, or a\n",
      "friend'--O this wicked woman! to trick me so! Every thing, man, woman,\n",
      "and beast, is in a plot against your poor Pamela, I think!--Then I\n",
      "know not one step of the way, nor how far to any house or cottage;\n",
      "and whether I could gain protection, if I got to a house: And now the\n",
      "robbers are abroad too, I may run into as great danger as I want to\n",
      "escape; nay, greater much, if these promising appearances hold: And sure\n",
      "my master cannot be so black as that they should not!--What can I do?--I\n",
      "have a good mind to try for it once more; but then I may be pursued and\n",
      "taken: and it will be worse for me; and this wicked woman will beat me,\n",
      "and take my shoes away, and lock me up.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, after all, if my master should mean well, he can't be angry at\n",
      "my fears, if I should escape; and nobody can blame me; and I can more\n",
      "easily be induced, with you, when all my apprehensions are over,\n",
      "to consider his proposal of Mr. Williams, than I could here; and he\n",
      "pretends, as you have read in his letter, he will leave me to my choice:\n",
      "Why then should I be afraid? I will go down again, I think! But yet my\n",
      "heart misgives me, because of the difficulties before me, in escaping;\n",
      "and being so poor and so friendless!--O good God! the preserver of the\n",
      "innocent! direct me what to do!\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I have just now a sort of strange persuasion upon me, that I\n",
      "ought to try to get way, and leave the issue to Providence. So, once\n",
      "more--I'll see, at least, if this bull be still there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alack-a-day! what a fate is this! I have not the courage to go, neither\n",
      "can I think to stay. But I must resolve. The gardener was in sight last\n",
      "time; so made me come up again. But I'll contrive to send him out of the\n",
      "way, if I can:--For if I never should have such another opportunity,\n",
      "I could not forgive myself. Once more I'll venture. God direct my\n",
      "footsteps, and make smooth my path and my way to safety!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, here I am, come back again! frightened, like a fool, out of all my\n",
      "purposes! O how terrible every thing appears to me! I had got twice as\n",
      "far again, as I was before, out of the back-door: and I looked and saw\n",
      "the bull, as I thought, between me and the door; and another bull coming\n",
      "towards me the other way: Well, thought I, here is double witchcraft, to\n",
      "be sure! Here is the spirit of my master in one bull, and Mrs. Jewkes's\n",
      "in the other. And now I am gone, to be sure! O help! cried I, like a\n",
      "fool, and ran back to the door, as swift as if I flew. When I had got\n",
      "the door in my hand, I ventured to look back, to see if these supposed\n",
      "bulls were coming; and I saw they were only two poor cows, a grazing in\n",
      "distant places, that my fears had made all this rout about. But as every\n",
      "thing is so frightful to me, I find I am not fit to think of my escape:\n",
      "for I shall be as much frightened at the first strange man that I meet\n",
      "with: and I am persuaded that fear brings one into more dangers, than\n",
      "the caution, that goes along with it, delivers one from.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then locked the door, and put the key in my pocket, and was in a sad\n",
      "quandary; but I was soon determined; for the maid Nan came in sight,\n",
      "and asked, if any thing was the matter, that I was so often up and down\n",
      "stairs? God forgive me, (but I had a sad lie at my tongue's end,) said\n",
      "I; Though Mrs. Jewkes is sometimes a little hard upon me, yet I know not\n",
      "where I am without her: I go up, and I come down to walk about in the\n",
      "garden; and, not having her, know scarcely what to do with myself. Ay,\n",
      "said the ideot, she is main good company, madam, no wonder you miss her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So here I am again, and here likely to be; for I have no courage to help\n",
      "myself any where else. O why are poor foolish maidens tried with such\n",
      "dangers, when they have such weak minds to grapple with them!--I\n",
      "will, since it is so, hope the best: but yet I cannot but observe how\n",
      "grievously every thing makes against me: for here are the robbers;\n",
      "though I fell not into their hands myself, yet they gave me as much\n",
      "terror, and had as great an effect upon my fears, as if I had: And here\n",
      "is the bull; it has as effectually frightened me, as if I had been hurt\n",
      "by it instead of the cook-maid; and so these joined together, as I may\n",
      "say, to make a very dastard of me. But my folly was the worst of all,\n",
      "because that deprived me of my money: for had I had that, I believe I\n",
      "should have ventured both the bull and the robbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Monday afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Mrs. Jewkes is returned from her visit: Well, said she, I would have\n",
      "you set your heart at rest; for Mr. Williams will do very well again. He\n",
      "is not half so bad as he fancied. O these scholars, said she, they have\n",
      "not the hearts of mice! He has only a few scratches on his face; which,\n",
      "said she, I suppose he got by grappling among the gravel at the bottom\n",
      "of the dam, to try to find a hole in the ground, to hide himself from\n",
      "the robbers. His shin and his knee are hardly to be seen to ail any\n",
      "thing. He says in his letter, he was a frightful spectacle: He might be\n",
      "so, indeed, when he first came in a doors; but he looks well enough now:\n",
      "and, only for a few groans now and then, when he thinks of his danger,\n",
      "I see nothing is the matter with him. So, Mrs. Pamela, said she, I would\n",
      "have you be very easy about it. I am glad of it, said I, for all your\n",
      "jokes, to Mrs. Jewkes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said she, he talks of nothing but you: and when I told him I would\n",
      "fain have persuaded you to come with me, the man was out of his wits\n",
      "with his gratitude to me: and so has laid open all his heart to me, and\n",
      "told me all that has passed, and was contriving between you two. This\n",
      "alarmed me prodigiously; and the rather, as I saw, by two or three\n",
      "instances, that his honest heart could keep nothing, believing every one\n",
      "as undesigning as himself. I said, but yet with a heavy heart, Ah! Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes, Mrs. Jewkes, this might have done with me, had he had any thing\n",
      "that he could have told you of. But you know well enough, that had we\n",
      "been disposed, we had no opportunity for it, from your watchful care and\n",
      "circumspection. No, said she, that's very true, Mrs. Pamela; not so\n",
      "much as for that declaration that he owned before me, he had found\n",
      "opportunity, for all my watchfulness, to make you. Come, come, said she,\n",
      "no more of these shams with me! You have an excellent head-piece for\n",
      "your years; but may be I am as cunning as you.--However, said she,\n",
      "all is well now; because my watchments are now over, by my master's\n",
      "direction. How have you employed yourself in my absence?\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so troubled at what might have passed between Mr. Williams and\n",
      "her, that I could not hide it; and she said, Well, Mrs. Pamela, since\n",
      "all matters are likely to be so soon and so happily ended, let me advise\n",
      "you to be a little less concerned at his discoveries; and make me your\n",
      "confidant, as he has done, and I shall think you have some favour for\n",
      "me, and reliance upon me; and perhaps you might not repent it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was so earnest, that I mistrusted she did this to pump me; and I\n",
      "knew how, now, to account for her kindness to Mr. Williams in her visit\n",
      "to him; which was only to get out of him what she could. Why, Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes, said I, is all this fishing about for something, where there\n",
      "is nothing, if there be an end of your watchments, as you call them?\n",
      "Nothing, said she, but womanish curiosity, I'll assure you; for one is\n",
      "naturally led to find out matters, where there is such privacy intended.\n",
      "Well, said I, pray let me know what he has said; and then I'll give you\n",
      "an answer to your curiosity. I don't care, said she, whether you do or\n",
      "not for I have as much as I wanted from him; and I despair of getting\n",
      "out of you any thing you ha'n't a mind I should know, my little cunning\n",
      "dear.--Well, said I, let him have said what he would, I care not: for I\n",
      "am sure he can say no harm of me; and so let us change the talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was the easier, indeed, because, for all her pumps, she gave no hints\n",
      "of the key and the door, etc. which, had he communicated to her, she\n",
      "would not have forborne giving me a touch of.--And so we gave up one\n",
      "another, as despairing to gain our ends of each other. But I am sure he\n",
      "must have said more than he should.--And I am the more apprehensive all\n",
      "is not right, because she has now been actually, these two hours, shut\n",
      "up a writing; though she pretended she had given me up all her stores\n",
      "of papers, etc. and that I should write for her. I begin to wish I had\n",
      "ventured every thing and gone off, when I might. O when will this state\n",
      "of doubt and uneasiness end!\n",
      "\n",

      "write it for my master's favour to me. Indeed, said I, I have no thanks\n",
      "to give, till I am with my father and mother: and besides, I sent a\n",
      "letter, as you know; but have had no answer to it. She said, she thought\n",
      "that his letter to Mr. Williams was sufficient; and the least I could\n",
      "do was to thank him, if but in two lines. No need of it, said I; for I\n",

      "\n",
      "I will close this day's writing, with just saying, that she is mighty\n",
      "silent and reserved, to what she was: and says nothing but No, or Yes,\n",
      "to what I ask. Something must be hatching, I doubt!--I the rather think\n",
      "so, because I find she does not keep her word with me, about lying\n",
      "by myself, and my money; to both which points she returned suspicious\n",
      "answers, saying, as to the one, Why, you are mighty earnest for your\n",
      "money; I shan't run away with it. And to the other, Good-lack! you need\n",
      "not be so willing, as I know of, to part with me for a bed-fellow, till\n",
      "you are sure of one you like better. This cut me to the heart; and, at\n",

      "reservedness, after her kind visit, and their freedom with one another,\n",
      "and much more at what I am going to tell you. He asked, If I would take\n",
      "a turn in the garden with Mrs. Jewkes and him. No, said she, I can't go.\n",
      "Said he, May not Mrs. Pamela take a walk?--No, said she; I desire she\n",
      "won't. Why, Mrs. Jewkes? said he: I am afraid I have somehow disobliged\n",
      "you. Not at all, replied she; but I suppose you will soon be at liberty\n",
      "to walk together as much as you please: and I have sent a messenger for\n",

      "quite struck of a heap, and put on, as I thought, a self-accusing\n",
      "countenance. So I went behind her back, and held my two hands together,\n",
      "flat, with a bit of paper, I had, between them, and looked at him:\n",
      "and he seemed to take me as I intended; intimating the renewing of the\n",
      "correspondence by the tiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "I left them both together, and retired to my closet to write a letter\n",

      "well think, that he who had so cunningly, and so wickedly, contrived\n",
      "all his stratagems hitherto, that it was impossible to avoid them, would\n",
      "stick at nothing to complete them. I fear I shall soon find it so!\n",
      "\n",
      "But one stratagem I have just invented, though a very discouraging one\n",
      "to think of; because I have neither friends nor money, nor know one step\n",
      "of the way, if I was out of the house. But let bulls, and bears, and\n",
      "lions, and tigers, and, what is worse, false, treacherous, deceitful\n",
      "men, stand in my way, I cannot be in more danger than I am; and I depend\n",
      "nothing upon his three weeks: for how do I know, now he is in such a\n",
      "passion, and has already begun his vengeance on poor Mr. Williams, that\n",
      "he will not change his mind, and come down to Lincolnshire before he\n",
      "goes to London?\n",
      "\n",
      "My stratagem is this: I will endeavour to get Mrs. Jewkes to go to bed\n",
      "without me, as she often does, while I sit locked up in my closet: and\n",
      "as she sleeps very sound in her first sleep, of which she never fails to\n",
      "give notice by snoring, if I can but then get out between the two bars\n",
      "of the window, (for you know I am very slender, and I find I can get\n",
      "my head through,) then I can drop upon the leads underneath, which\n",
      "are little more than my height, and which leads are over a little\n",
      "summer-parlour, that juts out towards the garden; and as I am light, I\n",
      "can easily drop from them; for they are not high from the ground: then I\n",
      "shall be in the garden; and then, as I have the key of the back-door,\n",
      "I will get out. But I have another piece of cunning still: Good Heaven,\n",
      "succeed to me my dangerous, but innocent devices!--I have read of a\n",
      "great captain, who, being in danger, leaped overboard into the sea,\n",
      "and his enemies, as he swam, shooting at him with bows and arrows, he\n",
      "unloosed his upper garment, and took another course, while they stuck\n",
      "that full of their darts and arrows; and so he escaped, and lived\n",
      "to triumph over them all. So what will I do, but strip off my upper\n",
      "petticoat, and throw it into the pond, with my neckhandkerchief! For to\n",
      "be sure, when they miss me, they will go to the pond first, thinking I\n",
      "have drowned myself: and so, when they see some of my clothes floating\n",
      "there, they will be all employed in dragging the pond, which is a very\n",
      "large one; and as I shall not, perhaps, be missed till the morning, this\n",
      "will give me opportunity to get a great way off; and I am sure I will\n",
      "run for it when I am out. And so I trust, that Providence will direct my\n",
      "steps to some good place of safety, and make some worthy body my friend;\n",
      "for sure, if I suffer ever so, I cannot be in more danger, nor in worse\n",
      "hands, than where I am; and with such avowed bad designs.\n",
      "\n",
      "O my dear parents! don't be frightened when you come to read this!--But\n",
      "all will be over before you can see it; and so God direct me for the\n",

      "never thought of before, and was hardly able to stand against: I mean,\n",
      "the weakness and presumption, both in one, of her own mind; which\n",
      "had well nigh, had not the divine grace interposed, sunk her into the\n",
      "lowest, last abyss of misery and perdition!\n",
      "\n",
      "I will proceed, as I have opportunity, with my sad relation: for my\n",

      "myself with: and indeed I have been so weak, that, till yesterday\n",
      "evening, I have not been able to hold a pen.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took with me but one shift, besides what I had on, and two\n",
      "handkerchiefs, and two caps, which my pocket held, (for it was not for\n",
      "me to encumber myself,) and all my stock of money, which was but five\n",
      "or six shillings, to set out for I knew not where; and got out of the\n",
      "window, not without some difficulty, sticking a little at my shoulders\n",
      "and hips; but I was resolved to get out, if possible. And it was farther\n",
      "from the leads than I thought, and I was afraid I had sprained my ancle;\n",
      "and when I had dropt from the leads to the ground, it was still farther\n",
      "off; but I did pretty well there, at least. I got no hurt to hinder me\n",
      "from pursuing my intentions. So being now on the ground, I hid my papers\n",
      "under a rose-bush, and covered them with mould, and there they still\n",
      "lie, as I hope. Then I hied away to the pond: The clock struck twelve,\n",
      "just as I got out; and it was a dark misty night, and very cold; but I\n",
      "felt it not then.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I came to the pond-side, I flung in my upper-coat, as I had\n",
      "designed, and my neckhandkerchief, and a round-eared cap, with a knot;\n",
      "and then with great speed ran to the door, and took the key out of my\n",
      "pocket, my poor heart beating all the time against my bosom, as if it\n",
      "would have forced its way through it: and beat it well might! for I\n",
      "then, too late, found, that I was most miserably disappointed; for the\n",
      "wicked woman had taken off that lock, and put another on; so that my\n",
      "key would not open it. I tried, and tried, and feeling about, I found\n",
      "a padlock besides, on another part of the door. O then how my heart\n",
      "sunk!--I dropt down with grief and confusion, unable to stir or support\n",
      "myself, for a while. But my fears awakening my resolution, and knowing\n",
      "that my attempt would be as terrible for me as any other danger I could\n",
      "then encounter, I clambered up upon the ledges of the door, and upon the\n",
      "lock, which was a great wooden one; and reached the top of the door with\n",
      "my hands; then, little thinking I could climb so well, I made shift to\n",
      "lay hold on the top of the wall with my hands; but, alas for me! nothing\n",
      "but ill luck!--no escape for poor Pamela! The wall being old, the bricks\n",
      "I held by gave way, just as I was taking a spring to get up; and down\n",
      "came I, and received such a blow upon my head, with one of the bricks,\n",
      "that it quite stunned me; and I broke my shins and my ancle besides, and\n",
      "beat off the heel of one of my shoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this dreadful way, flat upon the ground, lay poor I, for I believe\n",
      "five or six minutes; and then trying to get up, I sunk down again two or\n",
      "three times; and my left hip and shoulder were very stiff, and full of\n",
      "pain, with bruises; and, besides, my head bled, and ached grievously\n",
      "with the blow I had with the brick. Yet these hurts I valued not; but\n",
      "crept a good way upon my feet and hands, in search of a ladder, I just\n",
      "recollected to have seen against the wall two days before, on which the\n",
      "gardener was nailing a nectarine branch that was loosened from the\n",
      "wall: but no ladder could I find, and the wall was very high. What now,\n",
      "thought I, must become of the miserable Pamela!--Then I began to wish\n",
      "myself most heartily again in my closet, and to repent of my attempt,\n",
      "which I now censured as rash, because it did not succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "God forgive me! but a sad thought came just then into my head!--I\n",
      "tremble to think of it! Indeed my apprehensions of the usage I should\n",
      "meet with, had like to have made me miserable for ever! O my dear, dear\n",
      "parents, forgive your poor child; but being then quite desperate, I\n",
      "crept along, till I could raise myself on my staggering feet; and away\n",
      "limped I!--What to do, but to throw myself into the pond, and so put a\n",
      "period to all my griefs in this world!--But, O! to find them infinitely\n",
      "aggravated (had I not, by the divine grace, been withheld) in a\n",
      "miserable eternity! As I have escaped this temptation, (blessed be God\n",
      "for it!) I will tell you my conflicts on this dreadful occasion, that\n",
      "the divine mercies may be magnified in my deliverance, that I am yet on\n",
      "this side the dreadful gulf, from which there could have been no return.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was well for me, as I have since thought, that I was so maimed, as\n",
      "made me the longer before I got to the water; for this gave me time to\n",
      "consider, and abated the impetuousness of my passions, which possibly\n",
      "might otherwise have hurried me, in my first transport of grief, (on my\n",
      "seeing no way to escape, and the hard usage I had reason to expect from\n",
      "my dreadful keepers,) to throw myself in. But my weakness of body\n",
      "made me move so slowly, that it gave time, as I said, for a little\n",
      "reflection, a ray of grace, to dart in upon my benighted mind; and so,\n",
      "when I came to the pond-side, I sat myself down on the sloping bank, and\n",
      "began to ponder my wretched condition; and thus I reasoned with myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pause here a little, Pamela, on what thou art about, before thou takest\n",
      "the dreadful leap; and consider whether there be no way yet left, no\n",
      "hope, if not to escape from this wicked house, yet from the mischiefs\n",
      "threatened thee in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then considered; and, after I had cast about in my mind every thing\n",
      "that could make me hope, and saw no probability; a wicked woman, devoid\n",
      "of all compassion! a horrid helper, just arrived, in this dreadful\n",
      "Colbrand! an angry and resenting master, who now hated me, and\n",
      "threatened the most afflicting evils! and that I should, in all\n",
      "probability, be deprived even of the opportunity, I now had before\n",
      "me, to free myself from all their persecutions!--What hast thou to do,\n",
      "distressed creature, said I to myself, but throw thyself upon a merciful\n",
      "God, (who knows how innocently I suffer,) to avoid the merciless\n",
      "wickedness of those who are determined on my ruin?\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, thought I, (and oh! that thought was surely of the devil's\n",
      "instigation; for it was very soothing, and powerful with me,) these\n",
      "wicked wretches, who now have no remorse, no pity on me, will then be\n",
      "moved to lament their misdoings; and when they see the dead corpse of\n",
      "the unhappy Pamela dragged out to these dewy banks, and lying breathless\n",
      "at their feet, they will find that remorse to soften their obdurate\n",
      "heart, which, now, has no place there!--And my master, my angry master,\n",
      "will then forget his resentments, and say, O, this is the unhappy\n",
      "Pamela! that I have so causelessly persecuted and destroyed! Now do\n",
      "I see she preferred her honesty to her life, will he say, and is no\n",
      "hypocrite, nor deceiver; but really was the innocent creature she\n",
      "pretended to be! Then, thought I, will he, perhaps, shed a few tears\n",
      "over the poor corpse of his persecuted servant; and though he may give\n",
      "out, it was love and disappointment; and that, perhaps, (in order to\n",
      "hide his own guilt,) for the unfortunate Mr. Williams, yet will he be\n",
      "inwardly grieved, and order me a decent funeral, and save me, or rather\n",
      "this part of me, from the dreadful stake, and the highway interment;\n",
      "and the young men and maidens all around my dear father's will pity poor\n",
      "Pamela! But, O! I hope I shall not be the subject of their ballads and\n",
      "elegies; but that my memory, for the sake of my dear father and mother,\n",
      "may quickly slide into oblivion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was once rising, so indulgent was I to this sad way of thinking, to\n",

      "What art thou about to do, wretched Pamela? How knowest thou, though the\n",
      "prospect be all dark to thy short-sighted eye, what God may do for thee,\n",
      "even when all human means fail? God Almighty would not lay me under\n",
      "these sore afflictions, if he had not given me strength to grapple with\n",
      "them, if I will exert it as I ought: And who knows, but that the very\n",
      "presence I so much dread of my angry and designing master, (for he has\n",
      "had me in his power before, and yet I have escaped;) may be better for\n",
      "me, than these persecuting emissaries of his, who, for his money, are\n",
      "true to their wicked trust, and are hardened by that, and a long habit\n",
      "of wickedness, against compunction of heart? God can touch his heart in\n",
      "an instant; and if this should not be done, I can then but put an end to\n",
      "my life by some other means, if I am so resolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how do I know, thought I, that even these bruises and maims that I\n",
      "have gotten, while I pursued only the laudable escape I had meditated,\n",
      "may not kindly have furnished me with the opportunity I am now tempted\n",

      "which thou art now exercised? Art thou to put a bound to the divine\n",
      "will, and to say, Thus much will I bear, and no more? And wilt thou dare\n",
      "to say, That if the trial be augmented and continued, thou wilt sooner\n",
      "die than bear it?\n",
      "\n",
      "This act of despondency, thought I, is a sin, that, if I pursue it,\n",

      "Colbrand, and Nan, towards the back-door, to see if that was fast; while\n",
      "the cook was sent to the out-offices to raise the men, and make them get\n",
      "horses ready, to take each a several way to pursue me.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, it seems, finding that door double-locked and padlocked, and the\n",
      "heel of my shoe, and the broken bricks, they verily concluded I was got\n",
      "away by some means over the wall; and then, they say, Mrs. Jewkes\n",
      "seemed like a distracted woman: Till, at last, Nan had the thought to go\n",
      "towards the pond: and there seeing my coat, and cap, and handkerchief,\n",
      "in the water, cast almost to the banks by the agitation of the waves,\n",
      "she thought it was me; and, screaming out, ran to Mrs. Jewkes, and said,\n",
      "O, madam, madam! here's a piteous thing!--Mrs. Pamela lies drowned in\n",
      "the pond. Thither they all ran; and finding my clothes, doubted not\n",
      "I was at the bottom; and they all, Swiss among the rest, beat their\n",
      "breasts, and made most dismal lamentations; and Mrs. Jewkes sent Nan to\n",
      "the men, to bid them get the drag-net ready, and leave the horses, and\n",
      "come to try to find the poor innocent! as she, it seems, then called\n",
      "me, beating her breast, and lamenting my hard hap; but most what would\n",
      "become of them, and what account they should give to my master.\n",
      "\n",
      "While every one was thus differently employed, some weeping and wailing,\n",
      "some running here and there, Nan came into the wood-house; and there\n",
      "lay poor I; so weak, so low, and dejected, and withal so stiff with my\n",
      "bruises, that I could not stir, nor help myself to get upon my feet.\n",
      "And I said, with a low voice, (for I could hardly speak,) Mrs. Ann! Mrs.\n",
      "Ann!--The creature was sadly frightened, but was taking up a billet to\n",
      "knock me on the head, believing I was some thief, as she said; but\n",
      "I cried out, O Mrs. Ann, Mrs. Ann, help me, for pity's sake, to\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes! for I cannot get up!--Bless me, said she, what! you,\n",
      "madam!--Why, our hearts are almost broken, and we were going to drag the\n",
      "pond for you, believing you had drowned yourself. Now, said she, you'll\n",
      "make us all alive again!\n",
      "\n",
      "And, without helping me, she ran away to the pond, and brought all the\n",
      "crew to the wood-house.--The wicked woman, as she entered, said, Where\n",
      "is she?--Plague of her spells, and her witchcrafts! She shall dearly\n",
      "repent of this trick, if my name be Jewkes; and, coming to me, took hold\n",
      "of my arm so roughly, and gave me such a pull, as made me squeal out,\n",
      "(my shoulder being bruised on that side,) and drew me on my face. O\n",
      "cruel creature! said I, if you knew what I have suffered, it would move\n",
      "you to pity me!\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Colbrand seemed to be concerned, and said, Fie, madam, fie! you\n",
      "see she is almost dead! You must not be so rough with her. The coachman\n",
      "Robin seemed to be sorry for me too, and said, with sobs, What a\n",
      "scene is here! Don't you see she is all bloody in her head, and cannot\n",
      "stir?--Curse of her contrivance! said the horrid creature; she\n",
      "has frightened me out of my wits, I'm sure. How the d---l came you\n",
      "here?--Oh! said I, ask me now no questions, but let the maids carry\n",
      "me up to my prison; and there let me die decently, and in peace! For,\n",
      "indeed, I thought I could not live two hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "The still more inhuman tigress said, I suppose you want Mr. Williams to\n",
      "pray by you, don't you? Well, I'll send for my master this minute: let\n",
      "him come and watch you himself, for me; for there's no such thing as\n",
      "holding you, I'm sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the maids took me up between them, and carried me to my chamber; and\n",
      "when the wretch saw how bad I was, she began a little to relent--while\n",
      "every one wondered (at which I had neither strength nor inclination to\n",
      "tell them) how all this came to pass, which they imputed to sorcery and\n",
      "witchcraft.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so weak, when I had got up stairs, that I fainted away, with\n",
      "dejection, pain, and fatigue; and they undressed me, and got me to bed;\n",
      "and Mrs. Jewkes ordered Nan to bathe my shoulder, and arm, and ancle,\n",
      "with some old rum warmed; and they cut the hair a little from the back\n",
      "part of my head, and washed that; for it was clotted with blood, from\n",
      "a pretty long, but not a deep gash; and put a family plaister upon it;\n",
      "for, if this woman has any good quality, it is, it seems, in a readiness\n",
      "and skill to manage in cases, where sudden misfortunes happen in a\n",
      "family.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this, I fell into a pretty sound and refreshing sleep, and lay\n",
      "till twelve o'clock, tolerably easy, considering I was very feverish,\n",
      "and aguishly inclined; and she took a deal of care to fit me to undergo\n",
      "more trials, which I had hoped would have been happily ended: but\n",
      "Providence did not see fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "She would make me rise about twelve: but I was so weak, I could only sit\n",
      "up till the bed was made, and went into it again; and was, as they said,\n",
      "delirious some part of the afternoon. But having a tolerable night on\n",
      "Thursday, I was a good deal better on Friday, and on Saturday got up,\n",
      "and ate a little spoon-meat, and my feverishness seemed to be gone; and\n",
      "I was so mended by evening, that I begged her indulgence in my closet,\n",
      "to be left to myself; which she consented to, it being double-barred the\n",
      "day before, and I assuring her, that all my contrivances, as she called\n",
      "them, were at an end. But first she made me tell the whole story of my\n",
      "enterprise; which I did very faithfully, knowing now that nothing could\n",
      "stand me in any stead, or contribute to my safety and escape: And she\n",
      "seemed full of wonder at my resolution; but told me frankly, that I\n",
      "should have found it a hard matter to get quite off; for that she was\n",
      "provided with a warrant from my master (who is a justice of peace in\n",
      "this county as well as in the other) to get me apprehended, if I had got\n",
      "away, on suspicion of wronging him, let me have been where I would.\n",
      "\n",
      "O how deep-laid are the mischiefs designed to fall on my devoted\n",
      "head!--Surely, surely, I cannot be worthy of all this contrivance! This\n",
      "too well shews me the truth of what was hinted to me formerly at the\n",
      "other house, that my master swore he would have me! O preserve me,\n",
      "Heaven! from being his, in his own wicked sense of the adjuration!\n",
      "\n",
      "I must add, that now the woman sees me pick up so fast, she uses me\n",
      "worse, and has abridged me of paper, all but one sheet, which I am to\n",
      "shew her, written or unwritten, on demand: and has reduced me to one\n",
      "pen: yet my hidden stores stand me in stead. But she is more and more\n",
      "snappish and cross; and tauntingly calls me Mrs. Williams, and any thing\n",
      "she thinks will vex me.\n",

      "Sunday afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes has thought fit to give me an airing, for three or four\n",
      "hours, this afternoon; and I am a good deal better and should be much\n",
      "more so, if I knew for what I am reserved. But health is a blessing\n",
      "hardly to be coveted in my circumstances, since that but exposes me\n",
      "to the calamity I am in continual apprehensions of; whereas a weak and\n",
      "sickly state might possibly move compassion for me. O how I dread the\n",
      "coming of this angry and incensed master; though I am sure I have done\n",
      "him no harm!\n",
      "\n",
      "Just now we heard, that he had like to have been drowned in crossing the\n",

      "with all his ill usage of me, I cannot hate him? To be sure, I am not\n",
      "like other people! He has certainly done enough to make me hate him; but\n",
      "yet, when I heard his danger, which was very great, I could not in my\n",
      "heart forbear rejoicing for his safety; though his death would have\n",
      "ended my afflictions. Ungenerous master! if you knew this, you surely\n",
      "would not be so much my persecutor! But, for my late good lady's sake,\n",
      "I must wish him well; and O what an angel would he be in my eyes yet, if\n",
      "he would cease his attempts, and reform!\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I hear by Mrs. Jewkes, that John Arnold is turned away, being\n",
      "detected in writing to Mr. Williams; and that Mr. Longman, and Mr.\n",
      "Jonathan the butler, have incurred his displeasure, for offering to\n",
      "speak in my behalf. Mrs. Jervis too is in danger; for all these three,\n",

      "prostitute, than a gentleman's housekeeper; and she thinks she cannot\n",
      "use me bad enough for it. Bless me! she curses and storms at me like a\n",
      "trooper, and can hardly keep her hands off me. You may believe she\n",
      "must talk sadly, to make me say such harsh words: indeed it cannot be\n",
      "repeated; as she is a disgrace to her sex. And then she ridicules me,\n",

      "of broad stile, which leads into the road, and goes towards the town.\n",

      "body of folks running towards me from the house, men and women, as in a\n",
      "fright. At first I wondered what was the matter, till they came nearer;\n",
      "and I found they were all alarmed, thinking I had attempted to get off.\n",
      "There was first the horrible Colbrand, running with his long legs, well\n",
      "nigh two yards at a stride; then there was one of the grooms, poor\n",
      "Mr. Williams's robber; then I spied Nan, half out of breath, and the\n",
      "cook-maid after her! and lastly, came waddling, as fast as she could,\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes, exclaiming most bitterly, as I found, against me. Colbrand\n",

      "\n",
      "I sat still, to let them see I had no view to get away; for, besides\n",
      "the improbability of succeeding, my last sad attempt has cured me of\n",

      "her terribly incensed, and raving about my contrivances. Why, said I,\n",
      "should you be so concerned? Here I have sat a few minutes, and had not\n",
      "the least thought of getting away, or going farther; but to return as\n",
      "soon as it was duskish. She would not believe me; and the barbarous\n",
      "creature struck at me with her horrid fist, and, I believe, would have\n",
      "felled me, had not Colbrand interposed, and said, He saw me sitting\n",
      "still, looking about me, and not seeming to have the least inclination\n",
      "to stir. But this would not serve: She ordered the two maids to take\n",
      "me each by an arm, and lead me back into the house, and up stairs; and\n",
      "there have I been locked up ever since, without shoes. In vain have I\n",
      "pleaded, that I had no design, as indeed I had not the least; and last\n",
      "night I was forced to be between her and Nan; and I find she is resolved\n",
      "to make a handle of this against me, and in her own behalf.--Indeed,\n",

      "he came!\n",
      "\n",
      "He put on a stern and majestic air; and he can look very majestic when\n",

      "first salutation!--You do well, don't you, to give me all this trouble\n",
      "and vexation! I could not speak; but throwing myself on the floor, hid\n",
      "my face, and was ready to die with grief and apprehension.--He said,\n",
      "Well may you hide your face! well may you be ashamed to see me, vile\n",
      "forward one, as you are!--I sobbed and wept, but could not speak. And he\n",
      "let me lie, and went to the door, and called Mrs. Jewkes.--There, said\n",
      "he, take up that fallen angel!--Once I thought her as innocent as an\n",
      "angel of light but I have now no patience with her. The little hypocrite\n",
      "prostrates herself thus, in hopes to move my weakness in her favour, and\n",
      "that I'll raise her from the floor myself. But I shall not touch her:\n",
      "No, said he, cruel gentleman as he was! let such fellows as Williams\n",
      "be taken in by her artful wiles! I know her now, and see she is for any\n",
      "fool's turn, that will be caught by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sighed, as if my heart would break!--And Mrs. Jewkes lifted me up upon\n",
      "my knees; for I trembled so, I could not stand. Come, said she, Mrs.\n",
      "Pamela, learn to know your best friend; confess your unworthy behaviour,\n",
      "and beg his honour's forgiveness of all your faults. I was ready to\n",
      "faint: And he said, She is mistress of arts, I'll assure you; and will\n",
      "mimic a fit, ten to one, in a minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was struck to the heart at this; but could not speak presently; only\n",
      "lifted up my eyes to heaven!--And at last made shift to say--God forgive\n",
      "you, sir!--He seemed in a great passion, and walked up and down the\n",
      "room, casting sometimes an eye upon me, and seeming as if he would have\n",
      "spoken, but checked himself--And at last he said, When she has acted\n",
      "this her first part over, perhaps I will see her again, and she shall\n",
      "soon know what she has to trust to.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so he went out of the room: And I was quite sick at heart!--Surely,\n",
      "said I, I am the wickedest creature that ever breathed! Well, said the\n",
      "impertinent, not so wicked as that neither; but I am glad you begin\n",
      "to see your faults. Nothing like being humble!--Come, I'll stand your\n",
      "friend, and plead for you, if you'll promise to be more dutiful for\n",
      "the future: Come, come, added the wretch, this may be all made up by\n",
      "to-morrow morning, if you are not a fool.--Begone, hideous woman! said\n",
      "I, and let not my affliction be added to by thy inexorable cruelty, and\n",
      "unwomanly wickedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave me a push, and went away in a violent passion: And it seems,\n",

      "\n",
      "I laid me down on the floor, and had no power to stir, till the clock\n",

      "carry you down.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got up as well as I could, and trembled all the way down stairs:\n",
      "And she went before me into the parlour; and a new servant that he had\n",
      "waiting on him, instead of John, withdrew as soon as I came in: And,\n",
      "by the way, he had a new coachman too, which looked as if Bedfordshire\n",

      "at, that I demean myself thus to take notice of her?--See, said he, and\n",
      "took the glass with one hand, and turned me round with the other, what\n",
      "a shape! what a neck! what a hand! and what a bloom on that lovely\n",
      "face!--But who can describe the tricks and artifices, that lie lurking\n",
      "in her little, plotting, guileful heart! 'Tis no wonder the poor parson\n",

      "expect such artifice in so young a sorceress?\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to the farther part of the room, and held my face against the\n",
      "wainscot; and in spite of all I could do to refrain crying, sobbed as\n",

      "mistake of the letters you tell me of! But, you see, I am not afraid any\n",
      "body should read what I write. I don't carry on private correspondences,\n",

      "people to carry my letters against their duty, and all good conscience.\n",

      "the thought of this cursed parson, I believe in my heart, so great is my\n",
      "weakness, that I could not forgive this intriguing little slut, and take\n",
      "her to my bosom.\n",
      "\n",
      "O, said the sycophant, you are very good, sir, very forgiving,\n",
      "indeed!--But come, added the profligate wretch, I hope you will be so\n",

      "home: has corrupted all my servants at the other house; has despised my\n",
      "honourable views and intentions to her, and sought to run away with this\n",
      "ungrateful parson.--And surely I ought not to forgive all this!--Yet,\n",
      "with all this wretched grimace, he kissed me again, and would have put\n",
      "his hand into my bosom; but I struggled, and said, I would die before I\n",

      "consider where you are! and don't play the fool: If you do, a more\n",
      "dreadful fate awaits you than you expect. But take her up stairs, Mrs.\n",

      "sat up all night, for fear, if she would have let me. For I had but very\n",

      "bed-fellows again, these warm nights? Yes, said she, slippery-one, you\n",
      "are, till you can have one good one instead of us. Said I, Mrs. Jewkes,\n",
      "don't talk nastily to me: I see you are beginning again; and I shall\n",
      "affront you, may be; for next to bad actions, are bad words; for they\n",
      "could not be spoken, if they were not in the heart.--Come to bed,\n",
      "purity! said she. You are a nonsuch, I suppose. Indeed, said I, I can't\n",
      "come to bed; and it will do you no harm to let me stay all night in the\n",
      "great chair. Nan, said she, undress my young lady. If she won't let you,\n",
      "I'll help you; and, if neither of us can do it quietly, we'll call my\n",
      "master to do it for us; though, said she, I think it an office worthier\n",
      "of Monsieur Colbrand!--You are very wicked, said I. I know it, said she;\n",
      "I am a Jezebel, and a London prostitute, you know. You did great feats,\n",
      "said I, to tell my master all this poor stuff; but you did not tell him\n",
      "how you beat me. No, lambkin, said she, (a word I had not heard a good\n",
      "while,) that I left for you to tell and you was going to do it if the\n",

      "I can have neither justice nor mercy here, and cannot be heard in my\n",
      "defence, yet a time will come, may be, when I shall be heard, and when\n",
      "your own guilt will strike you dumb.--Ay! spirit, said she; and\n",
      "the vulture too! Must we both be dumb? Why that, lambkin, will be\n",
      "pretty!--Then, said the wicked one, you'll have all the talk to\n",
      "yourself!--Then how will the tongue of the pretty lambkin bleat out\n",
      "innocence, and virtue, and honesty, till the whole trial be at an\n",
      "end!--You're a wicked woman, that's certain, said I; and if you thought\n",
      "any thing of another world, could not talk thus. But no wonder!--It\n",
      "shews what hands I'm got into!--Ay, so it does, said she; but I beg\n",
      "you'll undress, and come to bed, or I believe your innocence won't keep\n",
      "you from still worse hands. I will come to bed, said I, if you will let\n",
      "me have the keys in my own hand; not else, if I can help it. Yes, said\n",
      "she, and then, hey for another contrivance, another escape!--No, no,\n",
      "said I, all my contrivances are over, I'll assure you! Pray let me have\n",
      "the keys, and I will come to bed. She came to me, and took me in her\n",
      "huge arms, as if I was a feather: Said she, I do this to shew you what\n",
      "a poor resistance you can make against me, if I please to exert myself;\n",
      "and so, lambkin, don't say to your wolf, I won't come to bed!--And set\n",
      "me down, and tapped me on the neck: Ah! said she, thou art a pretty\n",
      "creature, 'tis true; but so obstinate! so full of spirit! if thy\n",
      "strength was but answerable to that, thou would'st run away with us all,\n",
      "and this great house too on thy back!--But, undress, undress, I tell\n",
      "you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said I, I see my misfortunes make you very merry, and very witty\n",
      "too: but I will love you, if you will humour me with the keys of the\n",
      "chamber-doors.--Are you sure you will love me? said she: Now speak your\n",
      "conscience!--Why, said I, you must not put it so close; neither would\n",
      "you, if you thought you had not given reason to doubt it!--But I will\n",
      "love you as well as I can!--I would not tell a wilful lie: and if I did,\n",
      "you would not believe me, after your hard usage of me. Well, said she,\n",
      "that's all fair, I own!--But Nan, pray pull off my young lady's shoes\n",
      "and stockings.--No, pray don't, said I; I will come to bed presently,\n",
      "since I must.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so I went to the closet, and scribbled a little about this idle\n",
      "chit-chat. And she being importunate, I was forced to go to bed; but\n",
      "with some of my clothes on, as the former night; and she let me hold the\n",
      "two keys; for there are two locks, there being a double door; and so I\n",
      "got a little sleep that night, having had none for two or three nights\n",
      "before.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't imagine what she means; but Nan offered to talk a little once\n",
      "or twice; and she snubbed her, and said, I charge you, wench, don't open\n",
      "your lips before me; and if you are asked any questions by Mrs. Pamela,\n",
      "don't answer her one word, while I am here!--But she is a lordly woman\n",

      "oh! 'twas my abominable master, as you shall hear by and by,) sitting\n",
      "fast asleep, in an elbow-chair, in a dark corner of the room, with her\n",
      "apron thrown over her head and neck. And Mrs. Jewkes said, There is that\n",
      "beast of a wench fast asleep, instead of being a-bed! I knew, said she,\n",
      "she had taken a fine dose. I'll wake her, said I. No, don't, said she;\n",

      "All this time we were undressing ourselves: And I fetched a deep sigh!\n",
      "What do you sigh for? said she. I am thinking, Mrs. Jewkes, answered\n",
      "I, what a sad life I live, and how hard is my lot. I am sure, the thief\n",
      "that has robbed is much better off than I, 'bating the guilt; and I\n",
      "should, I think, take it for a mercy, to be hanged out of the way,\n",
      "rather than live in these cruel apprehensions. So, being not sleepy, and\n",
      "in a prattling vein, I began to give a little history of myself, as I\n",
      "did, once before, to Mrs. Jervis; in this manner:\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, said I, were my poor honest parents; they took care to instill\n",
      "good principles into my mind, till I was almost twelve years of age;\n",
      "and taught me to prefer goodness and poverty to the highest condition of\n",
      "life; and they confirmed their lessons by their own practice; for they\n",
      "were, of late years, remarkably poor, and always as remarkably honest,\n",
      "even to a proverb: for, As honest as goodman ANDREWS, was a byeword.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well then, said I, comes my late dear good lady, and takes a fancy to\n",
      "me, and said, she would be the making of me, if I was a good girl; and\n",
      "she put me to sing, to dance, to play on the spinnet, in order to divert\n",
      "her melancholy hours; and also taught me all manner of fine needle-work;\n",
      "but still this was her lesson, My good Pamela, be virtuous, and keep the\n",
      "men at a distance. Well, so I was, I hope, and so I did; and yet, though\n",
      "I say it, they all loved me and respected me; and would do any thing for\n",
      "me, as if I was a gentlewoman.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, then, what comes next?--Why, it pleased God to take my good lady:\n",
      "and then comes my master: And what says he?--Why, in effect, it is, Be\n",
      "not virtuous, Pamela.\n",
      "\n",
      "So here I have lived about sixteen years in virtue and reputation; and\n",
      "all at once, when I come to know what is good, and what is evil, I must\n",
      "renounce all the good, all the whole sixteen years' innocence, which,\n",
      "next to God's grace, I owed chiefly to my parents, and my lady's good\n",
      "lessons and examples, and choose the evil; and so, in a moment's time,\n",
      "become the vilest of creatures! And all this, for what, I pray? Why,\n",
      "truly, for a pair of diamond ear-rings, a necklace, and a diamond ring\n",
      "for my finger; which would not become me: For a few paltry fine\n",
      "clothes, which, when I wore them, would make but my former poverty more\n",
      "ridiculous to every body that saw me; especially when they knew the base\n",
      "terms I wore them upon. But, indeed, I was to have a great parcel of\n",
      "guineas beside; I forget how many; for, had there been ten times more,\n",
      "they would have been not so much to me, as the honest six guineas you\n",
      "tricked me out of, Mrs. Jewkes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, forsooth! but then I was to have I know not how many pounds a year\n",
      "for my life; and my poor father (there was the jest of it!) was to be\n",
      "the manager for the abandoned prostitute his daughter: And then, (there\n",
      "was the jest again!) my kind, forgiving, virtuous master, would pardon\n",
      "me all my misdeeds!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, thank him for nothing, truly. And what, pray, are all these violent\n",
      "misdeeds?--Why, they are for daring to adhere to the good lessons that\n",
      "were taught me; and not learning a new one, that would have reversed all\n",
      "my former: For not being contented when I was run away with, in order to\n",
      "be ruined; but contriving, if my poor wits had been able, to get out of\n",
      "danger, and preserve myself honest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then was he once jealous of poor John, though he knew John was his own\n",
      "creature, and helped to deceive me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then was he outrageous against poor Parson Williams! and him has this\n",
      "good, merciful master, thrown into gaol; and for what? Why, truly, for\n",
      "that, being a divine, and a good man, he had the fear of God before his\n",
      "eyes, and was willing to forego all his expectations of interest, and\n",
      "assist an oppressed poor creature.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, to be sure, I must be forward, bold, saucy, and what not! to dare\n",
      "to run away from certain ruin, and to strive to escape from an unjust\n",
      "confinement; and I must be married to the parson, nothing so sure!\n",
      "\n",
      "He would have had but a poor catch of me, had I consented: But he, and\n",
      "you too, know I did not want to marry any body. I only wanted to go to\n",
      "my poor parents, and to have my own liberty, and not to be confined by\n",
      "such an unlawful restraint; and which would not have been inflicted upon\n",
      "me, but only that I am a poor, destitute, young body, and have no friend\n",
      "that is able to right me.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Mrs. Jewkes, said I, here is my history in brief. And I am a very\n",
      "unhappy young creature, to be sure!--And why am I so?--Why, because my\n",
      "master sees something in my person that takes his present fancy; and\n",
      "because I would not be undone.--Why, therefore to choose, I must, and I\n",
      "shall be undone!--And this is all the reason that can be given!\n",
      "\n",
      "She heard me run on all this time, while I was undressing, without any\n",
      "interruption; and I said, Well, I must go to the two closets, ever since\n",
      "an affair of the closet at the other house, though he is so far off. And\n",
      "I have a good mind to wake this poor maid. No, don't, said she, I charge\n",
      "you. I am very angry with her, and she'll get no harm there; and if she\n",
      "wakes, she may come to bed well enough, as long as there is a candle in\n",
      "the chimney.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I looked into the closet, and kneeled down in my own, as I used to\n",
      "do, to say my prayers, and this with my underclothes in my hand, all\n",
      "undressed; and passed by the poor sleeping wench, as I thought, in my\n",
      "return. But, oh! little did I think it was my wicked, wicked master, in\n",
      "a gown and petticoat of hers, and her apron over his face and shoulders.\n",
      "What meanness will not Lucifer make his votaries stoop to, to gain their\n",
      "abominable ends!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes, by this time, was got to bed, on the farther side, as she\n",
      "used to be; and, to make room for the maid, when she should awake, I got\n",
      "into bed, and lay close to her. And I said, Where are the keys? though,\n",
      "said I, I am not so much afraid to-night. Here, said the wicked woman,\n",
      "put your arm under mine, and you shall find them about my wrist, as they\n",
      "used to be. So I did, and the abominable designer held my hand with her\n",
      "right-hand, as my right-arm was under her left.\n",
      "\n",
      "In less than a quarter of an hour, I said, There's poor Nan awake; I\n",
      "hear her stir. Let us go to sleep, said she, and not mind her: she'll\n",
      "come to bed, when she's quite awake. Poor soul! said I, I'll warrant she\n",
      "will have the head-ache finely to-morrow for this! Be silent, said\n",
      "she, and go to sleep; you keep me awake; and I never found you in so\n",
      "talkative a humour in my life. Don't chide me, said I; I will but say\n",
      "one thing more: Do you think Nan could hear me talk of my master's\n",
      "offers? No, no, said she; she was dead asleep. I'm glad of that, said I;\n",
      "because I would not expose my master to his common servants; and I knew\n",
      "you were no stranger to his fine articles. Said she, I think they were\n",
      "fine articles, and you were bewitched you did not close with them: But\n",
      "let us go to sleep. So I was silent; and the pretended Nan (O wicked,\n",
      "base, villanous designer! what a plot, what an unexpected plot was\n",
      "this!) seemed to be awaking; and Mrs. Jewkes, abhorrent creature! said,\n",
      "Come, Nan!--what, are you awake at last?--Pr'ythee come to bed; for Mrs.\n",
      "Pamela is in a talking fit, and won't go to sleep one while.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that, the pretended she came to the bed side; and, sitting down in\n",
      "a chair, where the curtain hid her, began to undress. Said I, Poor Mrs.\n",
      "Anne, I warrant your head aches most sadly! How do you do?\n",
      "\n",
      "--She answered not a word. Said the superlatively wicked woman, You know\n",
      "I have ordered her not to answer you. And this plot, to be sure, was\n",
      "laid when she gave her these orders the night before.\n",
      "\n",
      "I heard her, as I thought, breathe all quick and short : Indeed, said I,\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes, the poor maid is not well. What ails you, Mrs. Anne? And\n",
      "still no answer was made.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, I tremble to relate it! the pretended she came into bed, but\n",
      "trembled like an aspen-leaf; and I, poor fool that I was! pitied her\n",
      "much--but well might the barbarous deceiver tremble at his vile\n",
      "dissimulation, and base designs.\n",
      "\n",
      "What words shall I find, my dear mother (for my father should not see\n",
      "this shocking part), to describe the rest, and my confusion, when the\n",
      "guilty wretch took my left arm, and laid it under his neck, and the vile\n",
      "procuress held my right ; and then he clasped me round the waist!\n",
      "\n",
      "Said I, is the wench mad ? Why, how now, confidence! thinking still it\n",
      "had been Nan. But he kissed me with frightful vehemence; and then his\n",
      "voice broke upon me like a clap of thunder. Now, Pamela, said he, is the\n",
      "dreadful time of reckoning come, that I have threatened--I screamed out\n",
      "in such a manner, as never anybody heard the like. But there was nobody\n",
      "to help me : and both my hands were secured, as I said. Sure never poor\n",
      "soul was in such agonies as I. Wicked man! said I ; wicked abominable\n",
      "woman! O God! my God! this time! this one time! deliver me from\n",
      "this distress! or strike me dead this moment! And then I screamed\n",
      "again and again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Says he, One word with you, Pamela; one word hear me but; I must say one\n",
      "word to you, it is this: You see now you are in my power!--You cannot\n",
      "get from me, nor help yourself: Yet have I not offered any thing amiss\n",
      "to you. But if you resolve not to comply with my proposals, I will not\n",
      "lose this opportunity: If you do, I will yet leave you.\n",
      "\n",
      "O sir, said I, leave me, leave me but, and I will do any thing I ought\n",
      "to do.--Swear then to me, said he, that you will accept my proposals!\n",
      "With struggling, fright, terror, I fainted away quite, and did not come\n",
      "to myself soon, so that they both, from the cold sweats that I was in,\n",
      "thought me dying.--And I remember no more, than that, when with great\n",
      "difficulty they brought me to myself, she was sitting on one side of the\n",
      "bed, with her clothes on; and he on the other with his, and in his gown\n",
      "and slippers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your poor Pamela cannot answer for the liberties taken with her in her\n",
      "deplorable state of death. And when I saw them there, I sat up in my\n",
      "bed, without any regard to what appearance I made, and nothing about my\n",
      "neck; and he soothing me, with an aspect of pity and concern, I put my\n",
      "hand to his mouth, and said, O tell me, yet tell me not, what have I\n",
      "suffered in this distress? And I talked quite wild, and knew not what:\n",
      "for, to be sure, I was on the point of distraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "He most solemnly, and with a bitter imprecation, vowed, that he had\n",
      "not offered the least indecency; that he was frightened at the terrible\n",
      "manner I was taken with the fit: that he should desist from his attempt;\n",
      "and begged but to see me easy and quiet, and he would leave me directly,\n",
      "and go to his own bed. O then, said I, take with you this most wicked\n",
      "woman, this vile Mrs. Jewkes, as an earnest, that I may believe you!\n",
      "\n",
      "And will you, sir, said the wicked wretch, for a fit or two, give up\n",
      "such an opportunity as this?--I thought you had known the sex better.\n",
      "She is now, you see, quite well again!\n",
      "\n",
      "This I heard; more she might say; but I fainted away once more, at these\n",
      "words, and at his clasping his arms about me again. And, when I came\n",
      "a little to myself, I saw him sit there, and the maid Nan, holding a\n",
      "smelling-bottle to my nose, and no Mrs. Jewkes.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, taking my hand, Now will I vow to you, my dear Pamela, that\n",
      "I will leave you the moment I see you better, and pacified. Here's Nan\n",
      "knows, and will tell you, my concern for you. I vow to God, I have\n",
      "not offered any indecency to you: and, since I found Mrs. Jewkes so\n",
      "offensive to you, I have sent her to the maid's bed, and the maid\n",
      "shall be with you to-night. And but promise me, that you will compose\n",
      "yourself, and I will leave you. But, said I, will not Nan also hold my\n",
      "hand? And will not she let you come in again to me?--He said, By heaven!\n",
      "I will not come in again to-night. Nan, undress yourself, go to bed, and\n",
      "do all you can to comfort the dear creature: And now, Pamela, said he,\n",
      "give me but your hand, and say you forgive me, and I will leave you to\n",
      "your repose. I held out my trembling hand, which he vouchsafed to kiss;\n",
      "and I said, God forgive you, sir, as you have been just in my distress;\n",
      "and as you will be just to what you promise! And he withdrew, with a\n",
      "countenance of remorse, as I hoped; and she shut the doors, and, at my\n",
      "request, brought the keys to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, O my dear parents! was a most dreadful trial. I tremble still to\n",
      "think of it; and dare not recall all the horrid circumstances of it. I\n",
      "hope, as he assures me, he was not guilty of indecency; but have reason\n",
      "to bless God, who, by disabling me in my faculties, empowered me to\n",
      "preserve my innocence; and, when all my strength would have signified\n",
      "nothing, magnified himself in my weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so weak all day on Monday, that I could not get out of my bed. My\n",
      "master shewed great tenderness for me; and I hope he is really sorry,\n",
      "and that this will be his last attempt; but he does not say so neither.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came in the morning, as soon as he heard the door open and I began to\n",
      "be fearful. He stopped short of the bed, and said, Rather than give you\n",
      "apprehensions, I will come no farther. I said, Your honour, sir, and\n",
      "your mercy, is all I have to beg. He sat himself on the side of the bed,\n",
      "and asked kindly, how I did?--begged me to be composed; said, I still\n",
      "looked a little wildly. And I said, Pray, good sir, let me not see this\n",
      "infamous Mrs. Jewkes; I doubt I cannot bear her sight. She shan't come\n",
      "near you all this day, if you'll promise to compose yourself. Then,\n",
      "sir, I will try. He pressed my hand very tenderly, and went out. What a\n",
      "change does this shew!--O may it be lasting!--But, alas! he seems only\n",
      "to have altered his method of proceeding; and retains, I doubt, his\n",
      "wicked purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Tuesday, about ten o'clock, when my master heard I was up, he sent\n",
      "for me down into the parlour. As soon as he saw me, he said, Come nearer\n",
      "to me, Pamela. I did so, and he took my hand, and said, You begin to\n",
      "look well again: I am glad of it. You little slut, how did you frighten\n",
      "me on Sunday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, pray name not that night; and my eyes overflowed at the\n",
      "remembrance, and I turned my head aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said he, Place some little confidence in me: I know what those charming\n",
      "eyes mean, and you shall not need to explain yourself: for I do assure\n",
      "you, that as soon as I saw you change, and a cold sweat bedew your\n",
      "pretty face, and you fainted away, I quitted the bed, and Mrs. Jewkes\n",
      "did so too. And I put on my gown, and she fetched her smelling-bottle,\n",
      "and we both did all we could to restore you; and my passion for you was\n",
      "all swallowed up in the concern I had for your recovery; for I thought\n",
      "I never saw a fit so strong and violent in my life: and feared we should\n",
      "not bring you to life again; for what I saw you in once before was\n",
      "nothing to it. This, said he, might be my folly, and my unacquaintedness\n",
      "with what passion your sex can shew when they are in earnest. But this\n",
      "I repeat to you, that your mind may be entirely comforted--Whatever I\n",
      "offered to you, was before you fainted away, and that, I am sure, was\n",
      "innocent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, that was very bad: and it was too plain you had the worst\n",
      "designs. When, said he, I tell you the truth in one instance, you may\n",
      "believe me in the other. I know not, I declare, beyond this lovely\n",
      "bosom, your sex: but that I did intend what you call the worst is most\n",
      "certain: and though I would not too much alarm you now, I could curse my\n",
      "weakness, and my folly, which makes me own, that I love you beyond all\n",
      "your sex, and cannot live without you. But if I am master of myself, and\n",
      "my own resolution, I will not attempt to force you to any thing again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, you may easily keep your resolution, if you'll send me out\n",
      "of your way, to my poor parents; that is all I beg.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tis a folly to talk of it, said he. You must not, shall not go! And\n",
      "if I could be assured you would not attempt it, you should have better\n",
      "usage, and your confinement should be made easier to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to what end, sir, am I to stay? said I: You yourself seem not sure\n",
      "you can keep your own present good resolutions; and do you think, if I\n",
      "was to stay, when I could get away, and be safe, it would not look,\n",
      "as if either I confided too much in my own strength, or would tempt my\n",
      "ruin? And as if I was not in earnest to wish myself safe, and out of\n",
      "danger?--And then, how long am I to stay? And to what purpose? And\n",
      "in what light must I appear to the world? Would not that censure me,\n",
      "although I might be innocent? And you will allow, sir, that, if there be\n",
      "any thing valuable or exemplary in a good name, or fair reputation, one\n",
      "must not despise the world's censure, if one can avoid it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said he, I sent not for you on this account, just now; but for two\n",
      "reasons. The first is, That you promise me, that for a fortnight to come\n",
      "you will not offer to go away without my express consent; and this I\n",
      "expect for your own sake, that I may give you a little more liberty. And\n",
      "the second is, That you will see and forgive Mrs. Jewkes: she takes\n",
      "on much, and thinks that, as all her fault was her obedience to me,\n",
      "it would be very hard to sacrifice her, as she calls it, to your\n",
      "resentment.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the first, sir, said I, it is a hard injunction, for the reasons\n",
      "I have mentioned. And as to the second, considering her vile, unwomanly\n",
      "wickedness, and her endeavours to instigate you more to ruin me, when\n",
      "your returning goodness seemed to have some compassion upon me, it is\n",
      "still harder. But, to shew my obedience to your commands, (for you know,\n",
      "my dear parents, I might as well make a merit of my compliance, when\n",
      "my refusal would stand me in no stead,) I will consent to both; and to\n",
      "every thing else, that you shall be pleased to enjoin, which I can do,\n",
      "with innocence.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's my good girl! said he, and kissed me: This is quite prudent, and\n",
      "shews me, that you don't take insolent advantage of my favour for you;\n",
      "and will, perhaps, stand you in more stead than you are aware of.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he rung the bell, and said, Call down Mrs. Jewkes. She came down,\n",
      "and he took my hand, and put it into hers; and said, Mrs. Jewkes, I am\n",
      "obliged to you for all your diligence and fidelity to me; but Pamela, I\n",
      "must own, is not; because the service I employed you in was not so very\n",
      "obliging to her, as I could have wished she would have thought it: and\n",
      "you were not to favour her, but obey me. But yet I'll assure you, at the\n",
      "very first word, she has once obliged me, by consenting to be friends\n",
      "with you; and if she gives me no great cause, I shall not, perhaps, put\n",
      "you on such disagreeable service again.--Now, therefore, be you once\n",
      "more bed-fellows and board-fellows, as I may say, for some days longer;\n",
      "and see that Pamela sends no letters nor messages out of the house, nor\n",

      "on: you creep by little and little upon me; and now soothe me, and now\n",
      "threaten me; and if I should forbear to shew my resentment, when you\n",
      "offer incivilities to me, would not that be to be lost by degrees? Would\n",

      "what I dread? And have you not as good as avowed my ruin?--And have you\n",
      "once made me hope you will quit your purposes against me? How then, sir,\n",
      "can I act, but by shewing my abhorrence of every step that makes towards\n",
      "my undoing? And what is left me but words?--And can these words be other\n",
      "than such strong ones, as shall shew the detestation which, from the\n",
      "bottom of my heart, I have for every attempt upon my virtue? Judge for\n",
      "me, sir, and pardon me.\n",
      "\n",

      "boldness to justify yourself in your fault? Why don't you say, you never\n",
      "will again offend me? I will endeavour, sir, said I, always to preserve\n",
      "that decency towards you which becomes me. But really, sir, I must beg\n",
      "your excuse for saying, That when you forget what belongs to decency\n",
      "in your actions, and when words are all that are left me, to shew my\n",
      "resentment of such actions, I will not promise to forbear the strongest\n",

      "\n",
      "What, then, said he, do you beg pardon for? Where is the promise of\n",

      "that must absolutely depend on your usage of me: for I will bear any\n",
      "thing you can inflict upon me with patience, even to the laying down\n",
      "of my life, to shew my obedience to you in other cases; but I cannot be\n",

      "walked in, bidding me attend him in the garden, after dinner. So having\n",

      "nearer my happiness, or my misery, than ever I was. God protect me from\n",
      "the latter, if it be his blessed will! I have now such a scene to open\n",
      "to you, that, I know, will alarm both your hopes and your fears, as it\n",
      "does mine. And this it is:\n",
      "\n",
      "After my master had dined, he took a turn into the stables, to look at\n",
      "his stud of horses; and, when he came in, he opened the parlour-door,\n",
      "where Mrs. Jewkes and I sat at dinner; and, at his entrance, we both\n",
      "rose up; but he said, Sit still, sit still, and let me see how you eat\n",
      "your victuals, Pamela. O, said Mrs. Jewkes, very poorly, indeed, sir!\n",
      "No, said I, pretty well, sir, considering. None of your considerings,\n",
      "said he, pretty face; and tapped me on the cheek. I blushed, but was\n",
      "glad he was so good-humoured; but I could not tell how to sit before\n",
      "him, nor to behave myself. So he said, I know, Pamela, you are a nice\n",
      "carver: my mother used to say so. My lady, sir, said I, was very good to\n",
      "me in every thing, and would always make me do the honours of her table\n",
      "for her, when she was with her few select friends that she loved. Cut\n",
      "up, said he, that chicken. I did so. Now, said he, and took a knife and\n",
      "fork, and put a wing upon my plate, let me see you eat that. O sir, said\n",
      "I, I have eaten a whole breast of a chicken already, and cannot eat so\n",
      "much. But he said, I must eat it for his sake, and he would teach me to\n",
      "eat heartily: So I did eat it; but was much confused at his so kind and\n",
      "unusual freedom and condescension. And, good lack! you can't imagine how\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes looked and stared, and how respectful she seemed to me, and\n",
      "called me good madam, I'll assure you, urging me to take a little bit of\n",
      "tart.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master took two or three turns about the room, musing and thoughtful,\n",
      "as I had never before seen him; and at last he went out, saying, I\n",
      "am going into the garden: You know, Pamela, what I said to you before\n",
      "dinner. I rose, and courtesied, saying, I would attend his honour; and\n",
      "he said, Do, good girl!\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said Mrs. Jewkes, I see how things will go. O, madam, as she\n",
      "called me again, I am sure you are to be our mistress! And then I know\n",
      "what will become of me. Ah Mrs. Jewkes, said I, if I can but keep myself\n",
      "virtuous, 'tis the most of my ambition; and I hope, no temptation shall\n",
      "make me otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notwithstanding I had no reason to be pleased with his treatment of me\n",
      "before dinner, yet I made haste to attend him; and I found him walking\n",
      "by the side of that pond, which, for want of grace, and through a sinful\n",
      "despondence, had like to have been so fatal to me, and the sight of\n",
      "which, ever since, has been a trouble and reproach to me. And it was\n",
      "by the side of this pond, and not far from the place where I had that\n",
      "dreaded conflict, that my present hopes, if I am not to be deceived\n",
      "again, began to dawn: which I presume to flatter myself with being\n",
      "a happy omen for me, as if God Almighty would shew your poor sinful\n",
      "daughter, how well I did to put my affiance in his goodness, and not\n",
      "to throw away myself, because my ruin seemed inevitable, to my\n",
      "short-sighted apprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he was pleased to say, Well, Pamela, I am glad you are come of your\n",
      "own accord, as I may say: give me your hand. I did so; and he looked\n",
      "at me very steadily, and pressing my hand all the time, at last said, I\n",
      "will now talk to you in a serious manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have a good deal of wit, a great deal of penetration, much beyond\n",
      "your years, and, as I thought, your opportunities. You are possessed\n",
      "of an open, frank, and generous mind; and a person so lovely, that you\n",
      "excel all your sex, in my eyes. All these accomplishments have engaged\n",
      "my affection so deeply, that, as I have often said, I cannot live\n",
      "without you; and I would divide, with all my soul, my estate with you,\n",
      "to make you mine upon my own terms. These you have absolutely rejected;\n",
      "and that, though in saucy terms enough, yet in such a manner as makes\n",
      "me admire you the more. Your pretty chit-chat to Mrs. Jewkes, the last\n",
      "Sunday night, so innocent, and so full of beautiful simplicity, half\n",
      "disarmed my resolution before I approached your bed: And I see you so\n",
      "watchful over your virtue, that though I hoped to find it otherwise, I\n",
      "cannot but confess my passion for you is increased by it. But now,\n",
      "what shall I say farther, Pamela?--I will make you, though a party, my\n",
      "adviser in this matter, though not, perhaps, my definitive judge.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know I am not a very abandoned profligate; I have hitherto been\n",
      "guilty of no very enormous or vile actions. This of seizing you, and\n",
      "confining you thus, may perhaps be one of the worst, at least to persons\n",
      "of real innocence. Had I been utterly given up to my passions, I should\n",
      "before now have gratified them, and not have shewn that remorse and\n",
      "compassion for you, which have reprieved you, more than once, when\n",
      "absolutely in my power; and you are as inviolate a virgin as you were\n",
      "when you came into my house.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what can I do? Consider the pride of my condition. I cannot endure\n",
      "the thought of marriage, even with a person of equal or superior degree\n",
      "to myself; and have declined several proposals of that kind: How then,\n",
      "with the distance between us in the world's judgment, can I think of\n",
      "making you my wife?--Yet I must have you; I cannot bear the thoughts\n",
      "of any other man supplanting me in your affections: and the very\n",
      "apprehension of that has made me hate the name of Williams, and use him\n",
      "in a manner unworthy of my temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Pamela, judge for me; and, since I have told you, thus candidly, my\n",
      "mind, and I see yours is big with some important meaning, by your eyes,\n",
      "your blushes, and that sweet confusion which I behold struggling in your\n",
      "bosom, tell me, with like openness and candour, what you think I ought\n",
      "to do, and what you would have me do.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is impossible for me to express the agitations of my mind, on this\n",
      "unexpected declaration, so contrary to his former behaviour. His manner\n",
      "too had something so noble, and so sincere, as I thought, that, alas for\n",
      "me! I found I had need of all my poor discretion, to ward off the blow\n",
      "which this treatment gave to my most guarded thoughts. I threw myself at\n",
      "his feet; for I trembled, and could hardly stand: O sir, said I, spare\n",
      "your poor servant's confusion! O spare the poor Pamela!--Speak out, said\n",
      "he, and tell me, when I bid you, What you think I ought to do? I cannot\n",
      "say what you ought to do, answered I: but I only beg you will not ruin\n",
      "me; and, if you think me virtuous, if you think me sincerely honest, let\n",
      "me go to my poor parents. I will vow to you, that I will never suffer\n",
      "myself to be engaged without your approbation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still he insisted upon a more explicit answer to his question, of what\n",
      "I thought he ought to do. And I did, As to my poor thoughts of what you\n",
      "ought to do, I must needs say, that indeed I think you ought to regard\n",
      "the world's opinion, and avoid doing any thing disgraceful to your birth\n",
      "and fortune; and, therefore, if you really honour the poor Pamela with\n",
      "your respect, a little time, absence, and the conversation of worthier\n",
      "persons of my sex, will effectually enable you to overcome a regard so\n",
      "unworthy your condition: And this, good sir, is the best advice I can\n",
      "offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charming creature! lovely Pamela! said he, (with an ardour that was\n",
      "never before so agreeable to me,) this generous manner is of a piece\n",
      "with all the rest of your conduct. But tell me, still more explicitly,\n",
      "what you would advise me to, in the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "O, sir! said I, take not advantage of my credulity, and these my weak\n",
      "moments: but were I the first lady in the land, instead of the poor\n",
      "abject Pamela, I would, I could tell you. But I can say no more--\n",
      "\n",
      "O my dear father and mother! now I know you will indeed be concerned for\n",
      "me;--for now I am for myself.--And now I begin to be afraid I know\n",
      "too well the reason why all his hard trials of me, and my black\n",
      "apprehensions, would not let me hate him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But be assured still, by God's grace, that I shall do nothing unworthy\n",
      "of your Pamela; and if I find that he is still capable of deceiving me,\n",
      "and that this conduct is only put on to delude me more, I shall think\n",
      "nothing in this world so vile, and so odious; and nothing, if he be\n",
      "not the worst of his kind, (as he says, and, I hope, he is not,) so\n",
      "desperately guileful, as the heart of man.\n",
      "\n",
      "He generously said, I will spare your confusion, Pamela. But I hope I\n",
      "may promise myself, that you can love me preferably to any other man;\n",
      "and that no one in the world has had any share in your affections; for\n",
      "I am very jealous of what I love; and if I thought you had a secret\n",
      "whispering in your soul, that had not yet come up to a wish, for any\n",
      "other man breathing, I should not forgive myself to persist in my\n",
      "affection for you; nor you, if you did not frankly acquaint me with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I still continued on my knees, on the grass border by the pond-side,\n",
      "he sat himself down on the grass by me, and took me in his arms: Why\n",
      "hesitates my Pamela? said he.--Can you not answer me with truth, as I\n",
      "wish? If you cannot, speak, and I will forgive you.\n",
      "\n",
      "O good sir, said I, it is not that; indeed it is not: but a frightful\n",
      "word or two that you said to Mrs. Jewkes, when you thought I was not\n",
      "in hearing, comes cross my mind; and makes me dread that I am in more\n",

      "my pride struggles hard within me, I'll assure you; and if you doubt me,\n",
      "I have no obligation to your confidence or opinion. But, at present, I\n",

      "Well, said he, you may say what you have overheard; for, in not\n",
      "answering me directly, you put my soul upon the rack; and half the\n",
      "trouble I have had with you would have brought to my arms one of the\n",
      "finest ladies in England.\n",
      "\n",
      "O sir, said I, my virtue is as dear to me, as if I was of the highest\n",
      "quality; and my doubts (for which you know I have had too much reason)\n",
      "have made me troublesome. But now, sir, I will tell you what I heard,\n",
      "which has given me great uneasiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "You talked to Mrs. Jewkes of having begun wrong with me, in trying to\n",
      "subdue me with terror, and of frost, and such like--You remember it\n",
      "well:--And that you would, for the future, change your conduct, and try\n",
      "to melt me, that was your word, by kindness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I fear not, sir, the grace of God supporting me, that any acts of\n",
      "kindness would make me forget what I owe to my virtue: but, sir, I may,\n",
      "I find, be made more miserable by such acts, than by terror; because my\n",
      "nature is too frank and open to make me wish to be ungrateful: and if I\n",
      "should be taught a lesson I never yet learnt, with what regret should\n",
      "I descend to the grave, to think that I could not hate my undoer: and\n",
      "that, at the last great day, I must stand up as an accuser of the poor\n",
      "unhappy soul, that I could wish it in my power to save!\n",
      "\n",
      "Exalted girl! said he, what a thought is that!--Why, now, Pamela, you\n",
      "excel yourself! You have given me a hint that will hold me long. But,\n",
      "sweet creature, said he, tell me what is this lesson, which you never\n",
      "yet learnt, and which you are so afraid of learning?\n",
      "\n",
      "If, sir, said I, you will again generously spare my confusion, I need\n",
      "not speak it: But this I will say, in answer to the question you seem\n",
      "most solicitous about, that I know not the man breathing that I would\n",
      "wish to be married to, or that ever I thought of with such an idea. I\n",
      "had brought my mind so to love poverty, that I hoped for nothing but to\n",
      "return to the best, though the poorest of parents; and to employ myself\n",
      "in serving God, and comforting them; and you know not, sir, how you\n",
      "disappointed those hopes, and my proposed honest pleasures, when you\n",
      "sent me hither.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well then, said he, I may promise myself, that neither the parson, nor\n",
      "any other man, is any the least secret motive to your steadfast refusal\n",
      "of my offers? Indeed, sir, said I, you may; and, as you was pleased to\n",
      "ask, I answer, that I have not the least shadow of a wish, or thought,\n",
      "for any man living.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, said he, (for I am foolishly jealous, and yet it shews my fondness\n",
      "for you,) have you not encouraged Williams to think you will have him?\n",
      "Indeed, sir, said I, I have not; but the very contrary. And would you\n",
      "not have had him, said he, if you had got away by his means? I had\n",
      "resolved, sir, said I, in my mind, otherwise; and he knew it; and the\n",
      "poor man--I charge you, said he, say not a word in his favour! You will\n",
      "excite a whirlwind in my soul, if you name him with kindness; and then\n",
      "you'll be borne away with the tempest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, I have done!--Nay, said he, but do not have done; let me\n",
      "know the whole. If you have any regard for him, speak out; for it\n",
      "would end fearfully for you, for me, and for him, if I found that you\n",
      "disguised any secret of your soul from me, in this nice particular.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, if I have ever given you cause to think me sincere--Say\n",
      "then, said he, interrupting me with great vehemence, and taking both my\n",
      "hands between his, Say, that you now, in the presence of God, declare\n",
      "that you have not any the most hidden regard for Williams, or any other\n",
      "man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, I do. As God shall bless me, and preserve my innocence,\n",
      "I have not. Well, said he, I will believe you, Pamela; and in time,\n",
      "perhaps, I may better bear that man's name. And, if I am convinced that\n",
      "you are not prepossessed, my vanity makes me assured, that I need not\n",
      "to fear a place in your esteem, equal, if not preferable, to any man in\n",
      "England. But yet it stings my pride to the quick, that you was so easily\n",
      "brought, and at such a short acquaintance, to run away with that college\n",
      "novice!\n",
      "\n",
      "O good sir, said I, may I be heard one thing? And though I bring upon me\n",
      "your highest indignation, I will tell you, perhaps, the unnecessary and\n",
      "imprudent, but yet the whole truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "My honesty (I am poor and lowly, and am not entitled to call it honour)\n",
      "was in danger. I saw no means of securing myself from your avowed\n",
      "attempts. You had shewed you would not stick at little matters; and\n",
      "what, sir, could any body have thought of my sincerity, in preferring\n",
      "that to all other considerations, if I had not escaped from these\n",
      "dangers, if I could have found any way for it?--I am not going to say\n",
      "any thing for him; but, indeed, indeed, sir, I was the cause of putting\n",
      "him upon assisting me in my escape. I got him to acquaint me what gentry\n",
      "there were in the neighbourhood that I might fly to; and prevailed\n",
      "upon him--Don't frown at me, good sir; for I must tell you the whole\n",
      "truth--to apply to one Lady Jones; to Lady Darnford; and he was so good\n",
      "to apply to Mr. Peters, the minister: But they all refused me; and then\n",
      "it was he let me know, that there was no honourable way but marriage.\n",
      "That I declined; and he agreed to assist me for God's sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, said he, you are going--I boldly put my hand before his mouth,\n",
      "hardly knowing the liberty I took: Pray, sir, said I, don't be angry;\n",
      "I have just done--I would only say, that rather than have staid to be\n",
      "ruined, I would have thrown myself upon the poorest beggar that ever the\n",
      "world saw, if I thought him honest.--And I hope, when you duly weigh all\n",
      "matters, you will forgive me, and not think me so bold, and so forward,\n",
      "as you have been pleased to call me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said he, even in this your last speech, which, let me tell you,\n",
      "shews more your honesty of heart than your prudence, you have not\n",
      "over-much pleased me. But I must love you; and that vexes me not a\n",
      "little. But tell me, Pamela, for now the former question recurs: Since\n",
      "you so much prize your honour, and your virtue; since all attempts\n",
      "against that are so odious to you; and since I have avowedly made\n",
      "several of these attempts, do you think it is possible for you to love\n",
      "me preferably to any other of my sex?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, sir! said I, and here my doubt recurs, that you may thus graciously\n",
      "use me, to take advantage of my credulity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still perverse and doubting! said he--Cannot you take me as I am at\n",
      "present? And that, I have told you, is sincere and undesigning, whatever\n",
      "I may be hereafter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, sir! replied I, what can I say? I have already said too much, if\n",
      "this dreadful hereafter should take place. Don't bid me say how well I\n",
      "can--And then, my face glowing as the fire, I, all abashed, leaned upon\n",
      "his shoulder, to hide my confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "He clasped me to him with great ardour, and said, Hide your dear face in\n",
      "my bosom, my beloved Pamela! your innocent freedoms charm me!--But then\n",
      "say, How well--what?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you will be good, said I, to your poor servant, and spare her, I\n",
      "cannot say too much! But if not, I am doubly undone!--Undone indeed!\n",
      "\n",
      "Said he, I hope my present temper will hold; for I tell you frankly,\n",
      "that I have known, in this agreeable hour, more sincere pleasure than\n",
      "I have experienced in all the guilty tumults that my desiring soul\n",
      "compelled me into, in the hopes of possessing you on my own terms. And,\n",
      "Pamela, you must pray for the continuance of this temper; and I hope\n",
      "your prayers will get the better of my temptations.\n",
      "\n",
      "This sweet goodness overpowered all my reserves. I threw myself at his\n",
      "feet, and embraced his knees: What pleasure, sir, you give me at these\n",
      "gracious words, is not lent your poor servant to express!--I shall be\n",
      "too much rewarded for all my sufferings, if this goodness hold! God\n",
      "grant it may, for your own soul's sake as well as mine. And oh! how\n",
      "happy should I be, if----\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopt me, and said, But, my dear girl, what must we do about the\n",
      "world, and the world's censure? Indeed, I cannot marry!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now was I again struck all of a heap. However, soon recollecting myself,\n",
      "Sir, said I, I have not the presumption to hope such an honour. If I may\n",
      "be permitted to return in peace and safety to my poor parents, to pray\n",
      "for you there, it is all I at present request! This, sir, after all my\n",
      "apprehensions and dangers, will be a great pleasure to me. And, if I\n",
      "know my own poor heart, I shall wish you happy in a lady of suitable\n",
      "degree; and rejoice most sincerely in every circumstance that shall make\n",
      "for the happiness of my late good lady's most beloved son.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said he, this conversation, Pamela, is gone farther than I\n",
      "intended it. You need not be afraid, at this rate, of trusting yourself\n",
      "with me: but it is I that ought to be doubtful of myself, when I am with\n",
      "you.--But before I say any thing farther on this subject, I will take\n",
      "my proud heart to task; and, till then, let every thing be as if this\n",
      "conversation had never passed. Only, let me tell you, that the more\n",
      "confidence you place in me, the more you'll oblige me: but your doubts\n",
      "will only beget cause of doubts. And with this ambiguous saying, he\n",
      "saluted me with a more formal manner, if I may so say, than before, and\n",
      "lent me his hand; and so we walked toward the house, side by side, he\n",
      "seeming very thoughtful and pensive, as if he had already repented him\n",
      "of his goodness.\n",
      "\n",
      "What shall I do, what steps take, if all this be designing--O the\n",
      "perplexities of these cruel doubtings!--To be sure, if he be false, as\n",
      "I may call it, I have gone too far, much too far!--I am ready, on the\n",
      "apprehension of this, to bite my forward tongue (or rather to beat my\n",
      "more forward heart, that dictated to that poor machine) for what I have\n",
      "said. But sure, at least, he must be sincere for the time!--He could not\n",
      "be such a practised dissembler!--If he could, O how desperately wicked\n",
      "is the heart of man!--And where could he learn all these barbarous\n",
      "arts?--If so, it must be native surely to the sex!--But, silent be my\n",
      "rash censurings; be hushed, ye stormy tumults of my disturbed mind! for\n",
      "have I not a father who is a man?--A man who knows no guile! who would\n",
      "do no wrong!--who would not deceive or oppress, to gain a kingdom!--How\n",
      "then can I think it is native to the sex? And I must also hope my good\n",
      "lady's son cannot be the worst of men!--If he is, hard the lot of the\n",
      "excellent woman that bore him!--But much harder the hap of your poor\n",
      "Pamela, who has fallen into such hands!--But yet I will trust in God,\n",
      "and hope the best: and so lay down my tired pen for this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thursday morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somebody rapped at our chamber-door this morning, soon after it was\n",
      "light: Mrs. Jewkes asked, who it was? My master said, Open the door,\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes! O, said I, for God's sake, Mrs. Jewkes, don't! Indeed, said\n",
      "she, but I must. Then, said I, and clung about her, let me slip on my\n",
      "clothes first. But he rapped again, and she broke from me; and I was\n",
      "frightened out of my wits, and folded myself in the bed-clothes. He\n",
      "entered, and said, What, Pamela, so fearful, after what passed yesterday\n",
      "between us! O, sir, sir, said I, I fear my prayers have wanted their\n",
      "wished effect! Pray, good sir, consider--He sat down on the bed-side,\n",
      "and interrupted me; No need of your foolish fears; I shall say but a\n",
      "word or two, and go away.\n",
      "\n",
      "After you went up stairs, said he, I had an invitation to a ball, which\n",
      "is to be this night at Stamford, on occasion of a wedding; and I am\n",
      "going to call on Sir Simon, and his lady and daughters; for the bride is\n",
      "a relation of theirs: so I shall not be at home till Saturday. I come,\n",
      "therefore, to caution you, Mrs. Jewkes, before Pamela, (that she may\n",
      "not wonder at being closer confined, than for these three or four days\n",
      "past,) that nobody sees her, nor delivers any letter to her, in that\n",
      "space; for a person has been seen lurking about, and inquiring after\n",
      "her, and I have been well informed, that either Mrs. Jervis, or Mr.\n",
      "Longman, has written a letter, with a design of having it conveyed\n",
      "to her: And, said he, you must know, Pamela, that I have ordered Mr.\n",
      "Longman to give up his accounts, and have dismissed Jonathan and\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis, since I have been here; for their behaviour has been\n",
      "intolerable; and they have made such a breach between my sister Davers\n",
      "and me, as we shall never, perhaps, make up. Now, Pamela, I shall take\n",
      "it kindly in you, if you will confine yourself to your chamber pretty\n",
      "much, for the time I am absent, and not give Mrs. Jewkes cause of\n",
      "trouble or uneasiness; and the rather, as you know she acts by my\n",
      "orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! sir, said I, I fear all these good people have suffered for my\n",
      "sake!--Why, said he, I believe so too; and there was never a girl of\n",
      "your innocence, that set a large family in such an uproar, surely.--But\n",
      "let that pass. You know both of you my mind, and, in part, the reason of\n",
      "it. I shall only say, that I have had such a letter from my sister, as\n",
      "I could not have expected; and, Pamela, said he, neither you nor I have\n",
      "reason to thank her, as you shall know, perhaps at my return.--I go in\n",
      "my coach, Mrs. Jewkes, because I take Lady Darnford, and Mrs. Peters's\n",
      "niece, and one of Lady Darnford's daughters, along with me; and Sir\n",
      "Simon and his other daughter go in his chariot: so let all the gates be\n",
      "fastened; and don't take any airing in either of the chariots, nor let\n",
      "any body go to the gate, without you, Mrs. Jewkes. I'll be sure, said\n",
      "she, to obey your honour.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will give Mrs. Jewkes no trouble, sir, said I; and will keep pretty\n",
      "much in my chamber, and not stir so much as into the garden without her;\n",
      "to shew you I will obey in every thing I can. But I begin to fear--Ay,\n",
      "said he, more plots and contrivances, don't you?--But I'll assure you,\n",
      "you never had less reason; and I tell you the truth; for I am really\n",
      "going to Stamford this time; and upon the occasion I tell you. And so,\n",
      "Pamela, give me your hand, and one kiss; and then I am gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I durst not refuse, and said, God bless you, sir, wherever you go!--But\n",
      "I am sorry for what you tell me about your servants!\n",
      "\n",
      "He and Mrs. Jewkes had a little talk without the door; and I heard her\n",
      "say, You may depend, sir, upon my care and vigilance.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went in his coach, as he said he should, and very richly dressed,\n",
      "which looks as if what he said was likely: but really I have been used\n",
      "to so many tricks, and plots, and surprises, that I know not what to\n",
      "think. But I mourn for poor Mrs. Jervis.--So here is Parson Williams;\n",
      "here's poor naughty John; here is good Mrs. Jervis, and Mr. Longman, and\n",
      "Mr. Jonathan, turned away for me!--Mr. Longman is rich, indeed, and so\n",
      "need the less matter it; but I know it will grieve him: and for poor Mr.\n",
      "Jonathan, I am sure it will cut that good old servant to the heart. Alas\n",
      "for me! what mischiefs am I the occasion of!--Or, rather, my master,\n",
      "whose actions towards me have made so many of my kind friends forfeit\n",
      "his favour, for my sake!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am very sad about these things: If he really loved me, methinks he\n",
      "should not be so angry, that his servants loved me too.--I know not what\n",
      "to think!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have removed my papers from under the rose-bush; for I saw the\n",
      "gardener begin to dig near that spot; and I was afraid he would find\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes and I were looking yesterday through the iron gate that\n",
      "fronts the elms; and a gipsy-like body made up to us, and said; If,\n",
      "madam, you will give me some broken victuals, I will tell you both your\n",
      "fortunes. I said, Let us hear our fortunes, Mrs. Jewkes. She said, I\n",
      "don't like these sort of people; but we will hear what she'll say to\n",
      "us, however. I shan't fetch you any victuals, woman; but I will give you\n",
      "some pence, said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Nan coming out, she said, Fetch some bread, and some of the cold\n",
      "meat, and you shall have your fortune told, Nan.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, you'll think, like some of my other matters, a very trifling thing\n",
      "to write about. But mark the discovery of a dreadful plot, which I have\n",
      "made by it. O, bless me! What can I think of this naughty, this very\n",
      "naughty gentleman!--Now will I hate him most heartily. Thus it was:--\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes had no suspicion of the woman, the iron gate being locked,\n",
      "and she on the outside, and we on the inside; and so put her hand\n",
      "through. She said, muttering over a parcel of cramp words; Why, madam,\n",
      "you will marry soon, I can tell you. At that she seemed pleased, and\n",
      "said, I am glad to hear that; and shook her fat sides with laughing.\n",
      "The woman looked most earnestly at me, all the time, and as if she\n",
      "had meaning. Then it came into my head, from my master's caution, that\n",
      "possibly this woman might be employed to try to get a letter into my\n",
      "hands; and I was resolved to watch all her motions. So Mrs. Jewkes said,\n",
      "What sort of a man shall I have, pray?--Why, said she, a man younger\n",
      "than yourself; and a very good husband he'll prove.--I am glad of that,\n",
      "said she; and laughed again. Come, madam, let us hear your fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman came to me, and took my hand. O! said she, I cannot tell your\n",
      "fortune: your hand is so white and fine, I cannot see the lines: but,\n",
      "said she, and, stooping, pulled up a little tuft of grass, I have a way\n",
      "for that; and so rubbed my hand with the mould part of the tuft: Now,\n",
      "said she, I can see the lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes was very watchful of all her ways, and took the tuft, and\n",
      "looked upon it, lest any thing should be in that. And then the woman\n",
      "said, Here is the line of Jupiter crossing the line of life; and\n",
      "Mars--Odd! my pretty mistress, said she, you had best take care of\n",
      "yourself; for you are hard beset, I'll assure you. You will never be\n",
      "married, I can see; and will die of your first child. Out upon thee,\n",
      "woman! said I, better thou hadst never come here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said Mrs. Jewkes, whispering, I don't like this: it looks like a cheat:\n",
      "Pray, Mrs. Pamela, go in, this moment. So I will, said I; for I have\n",
      "enough of fortune-telling. And in I went.\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman wanted sadly to tell me more, which made Mrs. Jewkes threaten\n",
      "her, suspecting still the more; and away the woman went, having told Nan\n",
      "her fortune, and she would be drowned.\n",
      "\n",
      "This thing ran strongly in all our heads; and we went, an hour after, to\n",
      "see if the woman was lurking about, and took Mr. Colbrand for our guard.\n",
      "Looking through the iron gate, he spied a man sauntering about the\n",
      "middle of the walk; which filled Mrs. Jewkes with still more suspicions;\n",
      "and she said, Mr. Colbrand, you and I will walk towards this fellow, and\n",
      "see what he saunters there for: And, Nan, do you and madam stay at the\n",
      "gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they opened the iron gate and walked down towards the man; and\n",
      "guessing the woman, if employed, must mean something by the tuft of\n",

      "seemingly pulled up: then I doubted not something was there for me; and\n",
      "I walked to it, and standing over it, said to Nan, That's a pretty sort\n",
      "of wild flower, that grows yonder, near the elm, the fifth from us on\n",
      "the left; pray pull it for me. Said she, It is a common weed. Well, said\n",
      "I, but pull it for me; there are sometimes beautiful colours in a weed.\n",
      "\n",
      "While she went on, I stooped, and pulled up a good handful of the grass,\n",
      "and in it a bit of paper, which I put instantly in my bosom, and dropt\n",
      "the grass: and my heart went pit-a-pat at the odd adventure. Said I,\n",
      "Let's go in, Mrs. Anne. No, said she, we must stay till Mrs. Jewkes\n",
      "comes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was all impatience to read this paper: and when Colbrand and she\n",
      "returned, I went in. Said she, Certainly there is some reason for my\n",
      "master's caution: I can make nothing of this sauntering fellow; but,\n",
      "to be sure, there was some roguery in the gipsy. Well, said I, if there\n",
      "was, she lost her aim, you see! Ay, very true, said she; but that was\n",
      "owing to my watchfulness; and you was very good to go away, when I spoke\n",
      "to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hastened up stairs to my closet, and found the billet to contain, in a\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Twenty contrivances have been thought of to let you know your danger:\n",

      "to give you this caution, if it reaches your hands. The 'squire is\n",
      "absolutely determined to ruin you; and, because he despairs of any other\n",
      "way, he will pretend great love and kindness to you, and that he will\n",
      "marry you. You may expect a parson, for this purpose, in a few days; but\n",
      "it is a sly artful fellow, of a broken attorney, that he has hired to\n",
      "personate a minister. The man has a broad face, pitted much with the\n",
      "small-pox, and is a very great companion. So take care of yourself.\n",
      "Doubt not this advice. Perhaps you'll have had but too much reason\n",

      "this in reserve!--Here should I have been deluded with the hopes of a\n",

      "how dreadful must have been my lot, when I had found myself an undone\n",
      "creature, and a guilty harlot, instead of a lawful wife! Oh! this is\n",
      "indeed too much, too much, for your poor Pamela to support! This is the\n",
      "worse, as I hoped all the worst was over; and that I had the pleasure of\n",
      "beholding a reclaimed man, and not an abandoned libertine. What now must\n",
      "your poor daughter do? Now all her hopes are dashed! And if this fails\n",

      "to see if it was damaged by lying so long, Mrs. Jewkes came upon me by\n",

      "\n",

      "was intercepted, as it seems. Of the correspondence being carried on by\n",
      "a friend of his at Gainsborough. Of the horse he was to provide for me,\n",

      "mistake, was directed to me; and one to me, directed by like mistake\n",
      "to her; and very free reflections of mine upon both. The concern I\n",

      "These, down to the execution of my unfortunate plot to escape, are,\n",

      "still have safe, as I hope, sewed in my under-coat, about my hips.\n",
      "\n",
      "In vain were all my prayers and tears to her, to get her not to shew\n",
      "them to my master. For she said, It had now come out, why I affected to\n",
      "be so much alone; and why I was always writing. And she thought herself\n",
      "happy, she said, she had found these; for often and often had she\n",
      "searched every place she could think of, for writings, to no purpose\n",
      "before. And she hoped, she said, there was nothing in them by what any\n",
      "body might see; for, said she, you know you are all innocence!--Insolent\n",
      "creature! said I, I am sure you are all guilt!--And so you must do your\n",
      "worst; for now I can't help myself, and I see there is no mercy to be\n",
      "expected from you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just now, my master being come up, she went to him upon the stairs, and\n",
      "gave him my papers. There, sir, said she; you always said Mrs. Pamela\n",
      "was a great writer; but I never could get at any thing of hers before.\n",
      "He took them; and, without coming to me, went down to the parlour again.\n",
      "And what with the gipsy affair, and what with this, I could not think\n",
      "of going down to dinner; and she told him that too; and so I suppose I\n",
      "shall have him up stairs, as soon as his company is gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Saturday, six o'clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master came up, and, in a pleasanter manner than I expected,\n",
      "said, So, Pamela, we have seized, it seems, your treasonable papers?\n",
      "Treasonable! said I, very sullenly. Ay, said he, I suppose so; for you\n",
      "are a great plotter: but I have not read them yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, sir, said I, very gravely, it will be truly honourable in you not\n",
      "to read them; but to give them to me again. To whom, says he, are they\n",
      "written?--To my father, sir; but I suppose you see to whom.--Indeed,\n",
      "returned he, I have not read three lines yet. Then, pray, sir, don't\n",
      "read them; but give them to me again. That I will not, said he, till\n",
      "I have read them. Sir, said I, you served me not well in the letters\n",
      "I used to write formerly: I think it was not worthy your character\n",
      "to contrive to get them in your hands, by that false John Arnold! for\n",
      "should such a gentleman as you mind what your poor servant writes?--Yes,\n",
      "said he, by all means, mind what such a servant as my Pamela writes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your Pamela! thought I. Then the sham marriage came into my head; and\n",
      "indeed it has not been out of it, since the gipsy affair.--But, said\n",
      "he, have you any thing in these papers you would not have me see? To\n",
      "be sure, sir, said I, there is; for what one writes to one's father and\n",
      "mother, is not for every body to see. Nor, said he, am I every body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those letters, added he, that I did see by John's means, were not to\n",
      "your disadvantage, I'll assure you; for they gave me a very high opinion\n",
      "of your wit and innocence: And if I had not loved you, do you think I\n",
      "would have troubled myself about your letters?\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! sir, said I, great pride to me that! For they gave you such an\n",
      "opinion of my innocence, that you was resolved to ruin me. And what\n",
      "advantage have they brought me!--Who have been made a prisoner, and used\n",
      "as I have been between you and your housekeeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, Pamela, said he, a little seriously, why this behaviour, for my\n",
      "goodness to you in the garden?--This is not of a piece with your conduct\n",
      "and softness there, that quite charmed me in your favour: And you must\n",
      "not give me cause to think that you will be the more insolent, as\n",
      "you find me kinder. Ah! sir, said I, you know best your own heart and\n",
      "designs! But I fear I was too open-hearted then; and that you still\n",
      "keep your resolution to undo me, and have only changed the form of your\n",
      "proceedings.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I tell you once again, said he, a little sternly, that you cannot\n",
      "oblige me more, than by placing some confidence in me, I will let you\n",
      "know, that these foolish and perverse doubts are the worst things you\n",
      "can be guilty of. But, said he, I shall possibly account for the cause\n",
      "of them, in these papers of yours; for I doubt not you have been sincere\n",
      "to your father and mother, though you begin to make me suspect you: For\n",
      "I tell you, perverse girl, that it is impossible you should be thus cold\n",
      "and insensible, after what has passed in the garden, if you were not\n",
      "prepossessed in some other person's favour: And let me add, that if I\n",
      "find it so, it shall be attended with such effects, as will make every\n",
      "vein in your heart bleed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was going away in wrath; and I said, One word, good sir, one\n",
      "word before you read them, since you will read them: Pray make\n",
      "allowances--for all the harsh reflections that you will find in them,\n",
      "on your own conduct to me: And remember only, that they were not written\n",
      "for your sight; and were penned by a poor creature hardly used, and who\n",
      "was in constant apprehension of receiving from you the worst treatment\n",
      "that you could inflict upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "If that be all, said he, and there be nothing of another nature, that\n",
      "I cannot forgive, you have no cause for uneasiness; for I had as many\n",
      "instances of your saucy reflections upon me in your former letters, as\n",
      "there were lines; and yet, you see, I have never upbraided you on that\n",
      "score; though, perhaps, I wished you had been more sparing of your\n",
      "epithets, and your freedoms of that sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, sir, said I, since you will, you must read them; and I think I\n",
      "have no reason to be afraid of being found insincere, or having, in any\n",
      "respect, told you a falsehood; because, though I don't remember all\n",
      "I wrote, yet I know I wrote my heart; and that is not deceitful. And\n",
      "remember, sir, another thing, that I always declared I thought myself\n",
      "right to endeavour to make my escape from this forced and illegal\n",
      "restraint; and so you must not be angry that I would have done so, if I\n",
      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll judge you, never fear, said he, as favourably as you deserve; for\n",
      "you have too powerful a pleader within me. And so went down stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "About nine o'clock he sent for me down into the parlour. I went a little\n",
      "fearfully; and he held the paper in his hand, and said, Now, Pamela,\n",
      "you come upon your trial. Said I, I hope I have a just judge to hear my\n",
      "cause. Ay, said he, and you may hope for a merciful one too, or else I\n",
      "know not what will become of you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I expect, continued he, that you will answer me directly, and plainly,\n",
      "to every question I shall ask you.--In the first place, here are several\n",
      "love-letters between you and Williams. Love-letters! sir, said I.--Well,\n",
      "call them what you will, said he, I don't entirely like them, I'll\n",
      "assure you, with all the allowances you desired me to make for you. Do\n",
      "you find, sir, said I, that I encouraged his proposal, or do you not?\n",
      "Why, said he, you discourage his address in appearance; but no otherwise\n",
      "than all your cunning sex do to ours, to make us more eager in pursuing\n",
      "you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, sir, said I, that is your comment; but it does not appear so in\n",
      "the text. Smartly said! says he: Where a d---l gottest thou, at these\n",
      "years, all this knowledge? And then thou hast a memory, as I see by your\n",
      "papers, that nothing escapes. Alas! sir, said I, what poor abilities I\n",
      "have, serve only to make me more miserable!--I have no pleasure in my\n",
      "memory, which impresses things upon me, that I could be glad never were,\n",
      "or everlastingly to forget.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said he, so much for that--But where are the accounts (since you\n",
      "have kept so exact a journal of all that has befallen you) previous to\n",
      "these here in my hand? My father has them, sir, said I.--By whose means?\n",
      "said he--By Mr. Williams's, said I. Well answered, said he. But cannot\n",
      "you contrive to get me a sight of them? That would be pretty! said I. I\n",
      "wish I could have contrived to have kept those you have from your sight.\n",
      "Said he, I must see them, Pamela, or I shall never be easy; for I must\n",
      "know how this correspondence between you and Williams began: and if I\n",
      "can see them, it shall be better for you, if they answer what these give\n",
      "me hope they will.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can tell you, sir, very faithfully, said I, what the beginning was;\n",
      "for I was bold enough to be the beginner. That won't do, said he;\n",
      "for though this may appear a punctilio to you, to me it is of high\n",
      "importance. Sir, said I, if you please to let me go to my father, I will\n",
      "send them to you by any messenger you shall send for them. Will you so?\n",
      "But I dare say, if you will write for them, they will send them to you,\n",
      "without the trouble of such a journey to yourself: and I beg you will.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think, sir, said I, as you have seen all my former letters through\n",
      "John's baseness, and now these, through your faithful housekeeper's\n",
      "officious watchfulness, you might see all the rest: But I hope you\n",
      "will not desire it, till I can see how much my pleasing you in this\n",
      "particular will be of use to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must trust to my honour for that. But tell me, Pamela, said the sly\n",
      "gentleman, since I have seen these, would you have voluntarily shewn me\n",
      "those, had they been in your possession?\n",
      "\n",
      "I was not aware of this inference, and said, Yes, truly, sir, I think\n",
      "I should, if you commanded it. Well then, Pamela, said he, as I am sure\n",
      "you have found means to continue your journal, I desire, till the former\n",
      "part can come, that you will shew me the succeeding.--O sir, sir, said\n",
      "I, have you caught me so?--But indeed you must excuse me there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, said he, tell me truly, have you not continued your account till\n",
      "now? Don't ask me, sir, said I. But I insist upon your answer, replied\n",
      "he. Why then, sir, I will not tell an untruth; I have.--That's my good\n",
      "girl! said he, I love sincerity at my heart.--In another, sir, said I,\n",
      "I presume you mean!--Well, said he, I'll allow you to be a little witty\n",
      "upon me; because it is in you, and you cannot help it: but you will\n",
      "greatly oblige me, to shew me voluntarily what you have written. I long\n",
      "to see the particulars of your plot, and your disappointment, where your\n",
      "papers leave off: for you have so beautiful a manner, that it is partly\n",
      "that, and partly my love for you, that has made me desirous of reading\n",
      "all you write; though a great deal of it is against myself; for which\n",
      "you must expect to suffer a little: and as I have furnished you with the\n",
      "subject, I have a title to see the fruits of your pen.--Besides, said\n",
      "he, there is such a pretty air of romance, as you relate them, in your\n",
      "plots, and my plots, that I shall be better directed in what manner to\n",
      "wind up the catastrophe of the pretty novel.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I was your equal, sir, said I, I should say this is a very provoking\n",
      "way of jeering at the misfortunes you have brought upon me.\n",
      "\n",
      "O, said he, the liberties you have taken with my character in your\n",
      "letters, sets us upon a par, at least in that respect. Sir, I could not\n",
      "have taken those liberties, if you had not given me the cause: and the\n",
      "cause, sir, you know, is before the effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, Pamela, said he; you chop logic very prettily. What the deuse do\n",
      "we men go to school for? If our wits were equal to women's, we might\n",
      "spare much time and pains in our education: for nature teaches your\n",
      "sex, what, in a long course of labour and study, ours can hardly attain\n",
      "to.--But, indeed, every lady is not a Pamela.\n",
      "\n",
      "You delight to banter your poor servant, said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nay, continued he, I believe I must assume to myself half the merit of\n",
      "your wit, too; for the innocent exercises you have had for it, from me,\n",
      "have certainly sharpened your invention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, could I have been without those innocent exercises, as you\n",
      "are pleased to call them, I should have been glad to have been as dull\n",
      "as a beetle. But then, Pamela, said he, I should not have loved you so\n",
      "well. But then, sir, I should have been safe, easy, and happy.--Ay, may\n",
      "be so, and may be not; and the wife, too, of some clouterly plough-boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then, sir, I should have been content and innocent; and that's\n",
      "better than being a princess, and not so. And may be not, said he; for\n",
      "if you had had that pretty face, some of us keen fox-hunters should have\n",
      "found you out; and, in spite of your romantic notions, (which then, too,\n",
      "perhaps, would not have had so strong a place in your mind,) might have\n",
      "been more happy with the ploughman's wife, than I have been with my\n",
      "mother's Pamela. I hope, sir, said I, God would have given me more\n",
      "grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, but, resumed he, as to these writings of yours, that follow your\n",
      "fine plot, I must see them. Indeed, sir, you must not, if I can help\n",
      "it. Nothing, said he, pleases me better, than that, in all your arts,\n",
      "shifts, and stratagems, you have had a great regard to truth; and have,\n",
      "in all your little pieces of deceit, told very few wilful fibs. Now\n",
      "I expect you'll continue this laudable rule in your conversation with\n",
      "me.--Let me know then, where you have found supplies of pen, ink, and\n",
      "paper, when Mrs. Jewkes was so vigilant, and gave you but two sheets at\n",
      "a time?--Tell me truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, sir, little did I think I should have such occasion for them; but,\n",
      "when I went away from your house, I begged some of each of good Mr.\n",
      "Longman, who gave me plenty. Yes, yes, said he, it must be good Mr.\n",
      "Longman! All your confederates are good, every one of them: but such of\n",
      "my servants as have done their duty, and obeyed my orders, are painted\n",
      "out by you as black as devils! nay, so am I too, for that matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, I hope you won't be angry, but, saving yourself, do you\n",
      "think they are painted worse than they deserve? or worse than the parts\n",
      "they acted require?\n",
      "\n",
      "You say, saving myself, Pamela; but is not that saying a mere\n",
      "compliment to me, because I am present, and you are in my hands? Tell me\n",
      "truly.--Good sir, excuse me; but I fancy I might ask you, Why you should\n",
      "think so, if there was not a little bit of conscience that told you,\n",
      "there was but too much reason for it?\n",
      "\n",
      "He kissed me, and said, I must either do thus, or be angry with you; for\n",
      "you are very saucy, Pamela.--But, with your bewitching chit-chat, and\n",
      "pretty impertinence, I will not lose my question. Where did you hide\n",
      "your paper, pens, and ink?\n",
      "\n",
      "Some, sir, in one place, some in another; that I might have some left,\n",
      "if others should be found.--That's a good girl! said he; I love you\n",
      "for your sweet veracity. Now tell me where it is you hide your written\n",
      "papers, your saucy journal?--I must beg your excuse for that, sir, said\n",
      "I. But indeed, answered he, you will not have it: for I will know, and\n",
      "I will see them.--This is very hard, sir, said I; but I must say, you\n",
      "shall not, if I can help it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were standing most of this time; but he then sat down, and took me\n",
      "by both my hands, and said, Well said, my pretty Pamela, if you can help\n",
      "it! But I will not let you help it. Tell me, are they in your pocket?\n",
      "No, sir, said I; my heart up at my mouth. Said he, I know you won't tell\n",
      "a downright fib for the world: but for equivocation! no jesuit ever went\n",
      "beyond you. Answer me then, Are they in neither of your pockets? No,\n",
      "sir, said I. Are they not, said he, about your stays? No, sir, replied\n",
      "I: But pray no more questions: for ask me ever so much, I will not tell\n",
      "you.\n",
      "\n",
      "O, said he, I have a way for that. I can do as they do abroad, when the\n",
      "criminals won't confess; torture them till they do.--But pray, sir, said\n",
      "I, is this fair, just, or honest? I am no criminal; and I won't confess.\n",
      "\n",
      "O, my girl! said he, many an innocent person has been put to the\n",
      "torture. But let me know where they are, and you shall escape the\n",
      "question, as they call it abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, the torture is not used in England, and I hope you won't\n",
      "bring it up. Admirably said! said the naughty gentleman.--But I can tell\n",
      "you of as good a punishment. If a criminal won't plead with us, here\n",
      "in England, we press him to death, or till he does plead. And so now,\n",
      "Pamela, that is a punishment shall certainly be yours, if you won't tell\n",
      "without.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tears stood in my eyes, and I said, This, sir, is very cruel and\n",
      "barbarous.--No matter, said he; it is but like your Lucifer, you know,\n",
      "in my shape! And, after I have done so many heinous things by you as\n",
      "you think, you have no great reason to judge so hardly of this; or, at\n",
      "least, it is but of a piece with the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, sir, said I, (dreadfully afraid he had some notion they were about\n",
      "me,) if you will be obeyed in this unreasonable manner, though it is sad\n",
      "tyranny, to be sure!--let me go up to them, and read them over again,\n",
      "and you shall see so far as to the end of the sad story that follows\n",
      "those you have.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll see them all, said he, down to this time, if you have written so\n",
      "far:--Or, at least, till within this week.--Then let me go up to them,\n",
      "said I, and see what I have written, and to what day, to shew them\n",
      "to you; for you won't desire to see every thing. But I will, replied\n",
      "he.--But say, Pamela, tell me truth: Are they above? I was much\n",
      "affrighted. He saw my confusion. Tell me truth, said he. Why, sir,\n",
      "answered I, I have sometimes hid them under the dry mould in the garden;\n",
      "sometimes in one place, sometimes in another; and those you have in your\n",
      "hand, were several days under a rose-bush, in the garden. Artful slut!\n",
      "said he, What's this to my question?--Are they not about you?--If, said\n",
      "I, I must pluck them out of my hiding-place behind the wainscot, won't\n",
      "you see me?--Still more and more artful! said he--Is this an answer to\n",
      "my question?--I have searched every place above, and in your closet, for\n",
      "them, and cannot find them; so I will know where they are. Now, said he,\n",
      "it is my opinion they are about you; and I never undressed a girl in my\n",
      "life; but I will now begin to strip my pretty Pamela; and I hope I shall\n",
      "not go far before I find them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I fell a crying, and said, I will not be used in this manner. Pray, sir,\n",
      "said I, (for he began to unpin my handkerchief,) consider! Pray sir,\n",
      "do!--And pray, said he, do you consider. For I will see these papers.\n",
      "But may be, said he, they are tied about your knees, with your garters,\n",
      "and stooped. Was ever any thing so vile and so wicked?--I fell on my\n",
      "knees, and said, What can I do? What can I do? If you'll let me go up\n",
      "I'll fetch them to you. Will you, said he, on your honour, let me see\n",
      "them uncurtailed, and not offer to make them away; no not a single\n",
      "paper?--I will, sir.--On your honour? Yes, sir. And so he let me go up\n",
      "stairs, crying sadly for vexation to be so used. Sure nobody was ever so\n",
      "served as I am!\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to my closet, and there I sat me down, and could not bear the\n",
      "thoughts of giving up my papers. Besides, I must all undress me, in a\n",
      "manner, to untack them. So I writ thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'SIR,\n",
      "\n",
      "'To expostulate with such an arbitrary gentleman, I know will signify\n",
      "nothing; and most hardly do you use the power you so wickedly have got\n",
      "over me. I have heart enough, sir, to do a deed that would make you\n",
      "regret using me thus; and I can hardly bear it, and what I am further\n",
      "to undergo. But a superior consideration withholds me; thank God, it\n",
      "does!--I will, however, keep my word, if you insist upon it when\n",
      "you have read this; but, sir, let me beg of you to give me time till\n",
      "to-morrow morning, that I may just run them over, and see what I put\n",
      "into your hands against me: and I will then give my papers to you,\n",
      "without the least alteration, or adding or diminishing: But I should\n",
      "beg still to be excused, if you please: But if not, spare them to me but\n",
      "till to-morrow morning: and this, so hardly am I used, shall be thought\n",
      "a favour, which I shall be very thankful for.'\n",
      "\n",
      "I guessed it would not be long before I heard from him and he\n",
      "accordingly sent up Mrs. Jewkes for what I had promised. So I gave\n",
      "her this note to carry to him. And he sent word, that I must keep my\n",
      "promise, and he would give me till morning; but that I must bring them\n",
      "to him, without his asking again.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I took off my under-coat, and with great trouble of mind, unsewed\n",
      "them from it. And there is a vast quantity of it. I will just slightly\n",
      "touch upon the subjects; because I may not, perhaps, get them again for\n",
      "you to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "They begin with an account of 'my attempting to get away out of the\n",
      "window first, and then throwing my petticoat and handkerchief into the\n",
      "pond. How sadly I was disappointed, the lock of the back-door being\n",
      "changed. How, in trying to climb over the door, I tumbled down, and was\n",
      "piteously bruised; the bricks giving way, and tumbling upon me. How,\n",
      "finding I could not get off, and dreading the hard usage I should\n",
      "receive, I was so wicked as to think of throwing myself into the water.\n",
      "My sad reflections upon this matter. How Mrs. Jewkes used me upon this\n",
      "occasion, when she found me. How my master had like to have been drowned\n",
      "in hunting; and my concern for his danger, notwithstanding his usage\n",
      "of me. Mrs. Jewkes's wicked reports, to frighten me, that I was to be\n",
      "married to the ugly Swiss; who was to sell me on the wedding-day to\n",
      "my master. Her vile way of talking to me, like a London prostitute. My\n",
      "apprehensions of seeing preparations made for my master's coming. Her\n",
      "causeless fears that I was trying to get away again, when I had no\n",
      "thoughts of it; and my bad usage upon it. My master's dreadful arrival;\n",
      "and his hard, very hard treatment of me; and Mrs. Jewkes's insulting\n",
      "of me. His jealousy of Mr. Williams and me. How Mrs. Jewkes vilely\n",
      "instigated him to wickedness.' And down to here, I put into one parcel,\n",
      "hoping that would content him. But for fear it should not, I put into\n",
      "another parcel the following; viz.\n",
      "\n",
      "'A copy of his proposals to me, of a great parcel of gold, and fine\n",
      "clothes and rings, and an estate of I can't tell what a year; and 50l. a\n",
      "year for the life of both you, my dear parents, to be his mistress; with\n",
      "an insinuation, that, may be, he would marry me at the year's end: All\n",
      "sadly vile: With threatenings, if I did not comply, that he would ruin\n",
      "me, without allowing me any thing. A copy of my answer, refusing all,\n",
      "with just abhorrence: But begging at last his goodness towards me, and\n",
      "mercy on me, in the most moving manner I could think of. An account\n",
      "of his angry behaviour, and Mrs. Jewkes's wicked advice hereupon. His\n",
      "trying to get me to his chamber; and my refusal to go. A deal of stuff\n",
      "and chit-chat between me and the odious Mrs. Jewkes; in which she was\n",
      "very wicked and very insulting. Two notes I wrote, as if to be carried\n",
      "to church, to pray for his reclaiming, and my safety; which Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes seized, and officiously shewed him. A confession of mine, that,\n",
      "notwithstanding his bad usage, I could not hate him. My concern for Mr.\n",
      "Williams. A horrid contrivance of my master's to ruin me; being in\n",
      "my room, disguised in clothes of the maid's, who lay with me and Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes. How narrowly I escaped, (it makes my heart ache to think of it\n",
      "still!) by falling into fits. Mrs. Jewkes's detestable part in this sad\n",
      "affair. How he seemed moved at my danger, and forbore his abominable\n",
      "designs; and assured me he had offered no indecency. How ill I was for\n",
      "a day or two after; and how kind he seemed. How he made me forgive Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes. How, after this, and great kindness pretended, he made rude\n",
      "offers to me in the garden, which I escaped. How I resented them.' Then\n",
      "I had written, 'How kindly he behaved himself to me; and how he praised\n",
      "me, and gave me great hopes of his being good at last. Of the too tender\n",
      "impression this made upon me; and how I began to be afraid of my own\n",
      "weakness and consideration for him, though he had used me so ill.\n",
      "How sadly jealous he was of Mr. Williams; and how I, as justly could,\n",
      "cleared myself as to his doubts on that score. How, just when he had\n",
      "raised me up to the highest hope of his goodness, he dashed me sadly\n",
      "again, and went off more coldly. My free reflections upon this trying\n",
      "occasion.'\n",
      "\n",
      "This brought down matters from Thursday, the 20th day of my\n",
      "imprisonment, to Wednesday the 41st, and here I was resolved to end, let\n",
      "what would come; for only Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, remain to give\n",
      "an account of; and Thursday he set out to a ball at Stamford; and Friday\n",
      "was the gipsy story; and this is Saturday, his return from Stamford. And\n",
      "truly, I shall have but little heart to write, if he is to see all.\n",
      "\n",
      "So these two parcels of papers I have got ready for him against\n",
      "to-morrow morning. To be sure I have always used him very freely in my\n",
      "writings, and shewed him no mercy; but yet he must thank himself for\n",
      "it; for I have only writ truth; and I wish he had deserved a better\n",
      "character at my hands, as well for his own sake as mine.--So, though I\n",
      "don't know whether ever you'll see what I write, I must say, that I will\n",
      "go to bed, with remembering you in my prayers, as I always do, and as I\n",
      "know you do me: And so, my dear parents, good night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sunday morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remembered what he said, of not being obliged to ask again for my\n",
      "papers; and what I should be forced to do, and could not help, I thought\n",
      "I might as well do in such a manner as might shew I would not disoblige\n",
      "on purpose: though I stomached this matter very heavily too. I had\n",
      "therefore got in readiness my two parcels; and he, not going to church\n",
      "in the morning, bid Mrs. Jewkes tell me he was gone into the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew that was for me to go to him; and so I went: for how can I\n",
      "help being at his beck? which grieves me not a little, though he is my\n",
      "master, as I may say; for I am so wholly in his power, that it would\n",
      "do me no good to incense him; and if I refused to obey him in little\n",
      "matters, my refusal in greater would have the less weight. So I went\n",
      "down to the garden; but as he walked in one walk, I took another, that I\n",
      "might not seem too forward neither.\n",
      "\n",
      "He soon 'spied me, and said, Do you expect to be courted to come to me?\n",
      "Sir, said I, and crossed the walk to attend him, I did not know but I\n",
      "should interrupt you in your meditations this good day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was that the case, said he, truly, and from your heart? Why, sir, said\n",
      "I, I don't doubt but you have very good thoughts sometimes, though not\n",
      "towards me. I wish, said he, I could avoid thinking so well of you as\n",
      "I do. But where are the papers?--I dare say you had them about you\n",
      "yesterday; for you say in those I have, that you will bury your writings\n",
      "in the garden, for fear you should be searched, if you did not escape.\n",
      "This, added he, gave me a glorious pretence to search you; and I have\n",
      "been vexing myself all night, that I did not strip you garment by\n",
      "garment, till I had found them. O fie, sir, said I; let me not be\n",
      "scared, with hearing that you had such a thought in earnest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said he, I hope you have not now the papers to give me; for I had\n",
      "rather find them myself, I'll assure you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not like this way of talk at all; and thinking it best not to\n",
      "dwell upon it, said, Well, but, sir, you will excuse me, I hope, giving\n",
      "up my papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't trifle with me, said he; Where are they?--I think I was very good\n",
      "to you last night, to humour you as I did. If you have either added\n",
      "or diminished, and have not strictly kept your promise, woe be to you!\n",
      "Indeed, sir, said I, I have neither added nor diminished. But there is\n",
      "the parcel that goes on with my sad attempt to escape, and the terrible\n",
      "consequences it had like to have been followed with. And it goes down to\n",
      "the naughty articles you sent me. And as you know all that has happened\n",
      "since, I hope these will satisfy you.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was going to speak; but I said, to drive him from thinking of any\n",
      "more, And I must beg you, sir, to read the matter favourably, if I have\n",
      "exceeded in any liberties of my pen.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think, said he, half-smiling, you may wonder at my patience, that I\n",
      "can be so easy to read myself abused as I am by such a saucy slut.--Sir,\n",
      "said I, I have wondered you should be so desirous to see my bold stuff;\n",
      "and, for that very reason, I have thought it a very good, or a very bad\n",
      "sign. What, said he, is your good sign?--That it may have an effect upon\n",
      "your temper, at last, in my favour, when you see me so sincere. Your\n",
      "bad sign? Why, that if you can read my reflections and observations upon\n",
      "your treatment of me, with tranquillity, and not be moved, it is a sign\n",
      "of a very cruel and determined heart. Now, pray, sir, don't be angry at\n",
      "my boldness in telling you so freely my thoughts. You may, perhaps, said\n",
      "he, be least mistaken, when you think of your bad sign. God forbid! said\n",
      "I.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I took out my papers; and said, Here, sir, they are. But if you\n",
      "please to return them, without breaking the seal, it will be very\n",
      "generous: and I will take it for a great favour, and a good omen.\n",
      "\n",
      "He broke the seal instantly, and opened them: So much for your omen!\n",
      "replied he. I am sorry for it, said I, very seriously; and was walking\n",
      "away. Whither now? said he. I was going in, sir, that you might have\n",
      "time to read them, if you thought fit. He put them into his pocket, and\n",
      "said, You have more than these. Yes, sir: but all they contain, you know\n",
      "as well as I.--But I don't know, said he, the light you put things in;\n",
      "and so give them me, if you have not a mind to be searched.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, I can't stay, if you won't forbear that ugly word.--Give\n",
      "me then no reason for it. Where are the other papers? Why, then, unkind\n",
      "sir, if it must be so, here they are. And so I gave him, out of\n",
      "my pocket, the second parcel, sealed up, as the former, with this\n",
      "superscription; From the naughty articles, down, through sad attempts,\n",
      "to Thursday the 42d day of my imprisonment. This is last Thursday, is\n",
      "it? Yes, sir; but now you will see what I write, I will find some other\n",
      "way to employ my time: for how can I write with any face, what must be\n",
      "for your perusal, and not for those I intended to read my melancholy\n",
      "stories?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, said he, I would have you continue your penmanship by all means;\n",
      "and, I assure you, in the mind I am in, I will not ask you for any after\n",
      "these; except any thing very extraordinary occurs. And I have another\n",
      "thing to tell you, added he, that if you send for those from your\n",
      "father, and let me read them, I may, very probably, give them all back\n",
      "again to you. And so I desire you will do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This a little encourages me to continue my scribbling; but, for fear of\n",
      "the worst, I will, when they come to any bulk, contrive some way to\n",
      "hide them, if I can, that I may protest I have them not about me, which,\n",
      "before, I could not say of a truth; and that made him so resolutely bent\n",
      "to try to find them upon me; for which I might have suffered frightful\n",
      "indecencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "He led me, then, to the side of the pond; and sitting down on the slope,\n",
      "made me sit by him. Come, said he, this being the scene of part of your\n",
      "project, and where you so artfully threw in some of your clothes, I will\n",
      "just look upon that part of your relation. Sir, said I, let me then walk\n",
      "about, at a little distance; for I cannot bear the thought of it. Don't\n",
      "go far, said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came, as I suppose, to the place where I mentioned the bricks\n",
      "falling upon me, he got up, and walked to the door, and looked upon\n",
      "the broken part of the wall; for it had not been mended; and came back,\n",
      "reading on to himself, towards me; and took my hand, and put it under\n",
      "his arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, this, said he, my girl, is a very moving tale. It was a very\n",
      "desperate attempt, and, had you got out, you might have been in great\n",
      "danger; for you had a very bad and lonely way; and I had taken such\n",
      "measures, that, let you have been where you would, I should have had\n",
      "you.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may see, sir, said I, what I ventured, rather than be ruined; and\n",
      "you will be so good as hence to judge of the sincerity of my profession,\n",
      "that my honesty is dearer to me than my life. Romantic girl! said he,\n",
      "and read on.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was very serious at my reflections, on what God had enabled me to\n",
      "escape. And when he came to my reasonings about throwing myself into the\n",
      "water, he said, Walk gently before; and seemed so moved, that he turned\n",
      "away his face from me; and I blessed this good sign, and began not so\n",
      "much to repent at his seeing this mournful part of my story.\n",
      "\n",
      "He put the papers in his pocket, when he had read my reflections, and\n",
      "thanks for escaping from myself; and said, taking me about the waist, O\n",
      "my dear girl! you have touched me sensibly with your mournful relation,\n",
      "and your sweet reflections upon it. I should truly have been very\n",
      "miserable had it taken effect. I see you have been used too roughly; and\n",
      "it is a mercy you stood proof in that fatal moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he most kindly folded me in his arms: Let us, say I too, my Pamela,\n",
      "walk from this accursed piece of water; for I shall not, with pleasure,\n",
      "look upon it again, to think how near it was to have been fatal to my\n",
      "fair one. I thought, added he, of terrifying you to my will, since I\n",
      "could not move you by love; and Mrs. Jewkes too well obeyed me, when the\n",
      "terrors of your return, after your disappointment, were so great, that\n",
      "you had hardly courage to withstand them; but had like to have made so\n",
      "fatal a choice, to escape the treatment you apprehended.\n",
      "\n",
      "O sir, said I, I have reason, I am sure, to bless my dear parents,\n",
      "and my good lady, your mother, for giving me something of a religious\n",
      "education; for, but for that, and God's grace, I should, more than upon\n",
      "one occasion, have attempted, at least, a desperate act: and I the less\n",
      "wonder how poor creatures, who have not the fear of God before their\n",
      "eyes, and give way to despondency, cast themselves into perdition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Come, kiss me, said he, and tell me you forgive me for pushing you into\n",
      "so much danger and distress. If my mind hold, and I can see those former\n",
      "papers of yours, and that these in my pocket give me no cause to altar\n",
      "my opinion, I will endeavour to defy the world and the world's censures,\n",
      "and make my Pamela amends, if it be in the power of my whole life, for\n",
      "all the hardships I have made her undergo.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this looked well; but you shall see how strangely it was all turned.\n",
      "For this sham-marriage then came into my mind again; and I said, Your\n",
      "poor servant is far unworthy of this great honour; for what will it be\n",
      "but to create envy to herself, and discredit to you? Therefore, sir,\n",
      "permit me to return to my poor parents, and that is all I have to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was in a fearful passion then. And is it thus, said he, in my fond\n",
      "conceding moments, that I am to be despised and answered?--Precise,\n",
      "perverse, unseasonable Pamela! begone from my sight! and know as well\n",
      "how to behave in a hopeful prospect, as in a distressful state; and\n",
      "then, and not till then, shalt thou attract the shadow of my notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was startled, and going to speak: but he stamped with his foot, and\n",
      "said, Begone! I tell you: I cannot bear this stupid romantic folly.\n",
      "\n",
      "One word, said I; but one word, I beseech you, sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned from me in great wrath, and took down another alley, and so I\n",
      "went, with a very heavy heart; and fear I was too unseasonable, just at\n",
      "a time when he was so condescending: but if it was a piece of art of his\n",
      "side, as I apprehended, to introduce the sham-wedding, (and, to be sure,\n",
      "he is very full of stratagem and art,) I think I was not so much to\n",
      "blame.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I went up to my closet; and wrote thus far, while he walked about\n",
      "till dinner was ready; and he is now sat down to it, as I hear by Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes, very sullen, thoughtful, and out of humour; and she asks, What\n",
      "I have done to him?--Now, again, I dread to see him!--When will my fears\n",
      "be over?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Three o'clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, he continues exceeding wrath. He has ordered his travelling\n",
      "chariot to be got ready with all speed. What is to come next, I wonder!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure I did not say so much!--But see the lordliness of a high\n",
      "condition!--A poor body must not put in a word, when they take it into\n",
      "their heads to be angry! What a fine time a person of an equal condition\n",
      "would have of it, if she were even to marry such a one!--His poor dear\n",
      "mother spoiled him at first. Nobody must speak to him or contradict him,\n",
      "as I have heard, when he was a child; and so he has not been used to\n",
      "be controlled, and cannot bear the least thing that crosses his violent\n",
      "will. This is one of the blessings attending men of high condition! Much\n",
      "good may do them with their pride of birth, and pride of fortune! say\n",
      "I:--All that it serves for, as far as I can see, is, to multiply their\n",
      "disquiets, and every body's else that has to do with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, so! where will this end?--Mrs. Jewkes has been with me from him,\n",
      "and she says, I must get out of the house this moment. Well, said I, but\n",
      "whither am I to be carried next? Why, home, said she, to your father and\n",
      "mother. And can it be? said I; No, no, I doubt I shall not be so happy\n",
      "as that!--To be sure some bad design is on foot again! To be sure it\n",
      "is!--Sure, sure, said I, Mrs. Jewkes, he has not found out some other\n",
      "housekeeper worse than you! She was very angry, you may well think. But\n",
      "I know she can't be made worse than she is.\n",
      "\n",
      "She came up again. Are you ready? said she. Bless me, said I, you are\n",
      "very hasty! I have heard of this not a quarter of an hour ago. But I\n",
      "shall be soon ready; for I have but little to take with me, and no kind\n",
      "friends in this house to take leave of, to delay me. Yet, like a fool, I\n",
      "can't help crying.--Pray, said I, just step down, and ask, if I may not\n",
      "have my papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I am quite ready now, against she comes up with an answer; and so I\n",
      "will put up these few writings in my bosom, that I have left.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know what to think--nor how to judge; but I shall never believe\n",
      "I am with you, till I am on my knees before you, begging both your\n",
      "blessings. Yet I am sorry he is so angry with me! I thought I did not\n",
      "say so much!\n",
      "\n",
      "There is, I see, the chariot drawn out, the horses too, the grim\n",
      "Colbrand going to get on horseback. What will be the end of all this?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, where this will end, I cannot say. But here I am, at a little poor\n",
      "village, almost such a one as yours! I shall learn the name of it by\n",
      "and by: and Robin assures me, he has orders to carry me to you, my dear\n",
      "father and mother. O that he may say truth, and not deceive me again!\n",
      "But having nothing else to do, and I am sure I shall not sleep a wink\n",
      "to-night, if I was to go to bed, I will write my time away, and take up\n",
      "my story where I left off, on Sunday afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes came up to me, with this answer about my papers: My master\n",
      "says, he will not read them yet, lest he should be moved by any thing in\n",
      "them to alter his resolution. But if he should think it worth while to\n",
      "read them, he will send them to you, afterwards, to your father's. But,\n",
      "said she, here are your guineas that I borrowed: for all is over now\n",
      "with you, I find.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw me cry, and said, Do you repent?--Of what? said I.--Nay, I can't\n",
      "tell, replied she; but, to be sure, he has had a taste of your satirical\n",
      "flings, or he would not be so angry. O! continued she, and held up her\n",
      "hand, thou hast a spirit!--But I hope it will now be brought down.--I\n",
      "hope so too, said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, added I, I am ready. She lifted up the window, and said, I'll call\n",
      "Robin to take your portmanteau: Bag and baggage! proceeded she, I'm\n",
      "glad you're going. I have no words, said I, to throw away upon you, Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes; but, making her a very low courtesy, I most heartily thank you\n",
      "for all your virtuous civilities to me. And so adieu; for I'll have no\n",
      "portmanteau, I'll assure you, nor any thing but these few things that\n",
      "I brought with me in my handkerchief, besides what I have on. For I had\n",
      "all this time worn my own bought clothes, though my master would have\n",
      "had it otherwise often: but I had put up paper, ink, and pens, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "So down I went, and as I passed by the parlour, she stepped in, and\n",
      "said, Sir, you have nothing to say to the girl before she goes? I heard\n",
      "him reply, though I did not see him, Who bid you say, the girl, Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes, in that manner? She has offended only me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I beg your honour's pardon, said the wretch; but if I was your honour,\n",
      "she should not, for all the trouble she has cost you, go away scot-free.\n",
      "No more of this, as I told you before, said he: What! when I have such\n",
      "proof, that her virtue is all her pride, shall I rob her of that?--No,\n",
      "added he, let her go, perverse and foolish as she is; but she deserves\n",
      "to go honest, and she shall go so!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so transported with this unexpected goodness, that I opened the\n",
      "door before I knew what I did; and said, falling on my knees at the\n",
      "door, with my hands folded, and lifted up, O thank you, thank your\n",
      "honour, a million of times!--May God bless you for this instance of your\n",
      "goodness to me! I will pray for you as long as I live, and so shall my\n",
      "dear father and mother. And, Mrs. Jewkes, said I, I will pray for you\n",
      "too, poor wicked wretch that you are!\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned from me, and went into his closet, and shut the door. He need\n",
      "not have done so; for I would not have gone nearer to him!\n",
      "\n",
      "Surely I did not say so much, to incur all this displeasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I was loath to leave the house. Can you believe it?--What could\n",
      "be the matter with me, I wonder?--I felt something so strange, and\n",
      "my heart was so lumpish!--I wonder what ailed me!--But this was so\n",
      "unexpected!--I believe that was all!--Yet I am very strange still.\n",
      "Surely, surely, I cannot be like the old murmuring Israelites, to long\n",
      "after the onions and garlick of Egypt, when they had suffered there such\n",
      "heavy bondage?--I'll take thee, O lumpish, contradictory, ungovernable\n",
      "heart! to severe task, for this thy strange impulse, when I get to my\n",
      "dear father's and mother's; and if I find any thing in thee that should\n",
      "not be, depend upon it thou shalt be humbled, if strict abstinence,\n",
      "prayer, and mortification, will do it!\n",
      "\n",
      "But yet, after all, this last goodness of his has touched me too\n",
      "sensibly. I wish I had not heard it, almost; and yet, methinks, I am\n",
      "glad I did; for I should rejoice to think the best of him, for his own\n",
      "sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, and so I went out to the chariot, the same that brought me down.\n",
      "So, Mr. Robert, said I, here I am again! a poor sporting-piece for the\n",
      "great! a mere tennis-ball of fortune! You have your orders, I hope. Yes,\n",
      "madam, said he. Pray, now, said I, don't madam me, nor stand with your\n",
      "hat off to such a one as I. Had not my master, said he, ordered me not\n",
      "to be wanting in respect to you, I would have shewn you all I could.\n",
      "Well, said I, with my heart full, that's very kind, Mr. Robert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Colbrand, mounted on horseback, with pistols before him, came up to\n",
      "me, as soon as I got in, with his hat off too. What, monsieur! said I,\n",
      "are you to go with me?--Part of the way, he said, to see you safe. I\n",
      "hope that's kind too, in you, Mr. Colbrand, said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had nobody to wave my handkerchief to now, nor to take leave of; and\n",
      "so I resigned myself to my contemplations, with this strange wayward\n",
      "heart of mine, that I never found so ungovernable and awkward before.\n",
      "\n",
      "So away drove the chariot!--And when I had got out of the elm-walk, and\n",
      "into the great road, I could hardly think but I was in a dream all the\n",
      "time. A few hours before, in my master's arms almost, with twenty kind\n",
      "things said to me, and a generous concern for the misfortunes he had\n",
      "brought upon me; and only by one rash half-word exasperated against\n",
      "me, and turned out of doors, at an hour's warning; and all his kindness\n",
      "changed to hate! And I now, from three o'clock to five, several miles\n",
      "off! But if I am going to you, all will be well again, I hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lack-a-day, what strange creatures are men! gentlemen, I should say,\n",
      "rather! For, my dear deserving good mother, though poverty be both your\n",
      "lots, has had better hap, and you are, and have always been, blest in\n",
      "one another!--Yet this pleases me too; he was so good, he would not let\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes speak ill of me, and scorned to take her odious unwomanly\n",
      "advice. O, what a black heart has this poor wretch! So I need not rail\n",
      "against men so much; for my master, bad as I have thought him, is not\n",
      "half so bad as this woman.--To be sure she must be an atheist!--Do you\n",
      "think she is not?\n",
      "\n",
      "We could not reach further than this little poor place and sad alehouse,\n",
      "rather than inn; for it began to be dark, and Robin did not make so much\n",
      "haste as he might have done; and he was forced to make hard shift for\n",
      "his horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Colbrand, and Robert too, are very civil. I see he has got my\n",
      "portmanteau lashed behind the coach. I did not desire it; but I shall\n",
      "not come quite empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "A thorough riddance of me, I see!--Bag and baggage! as Mrs. Jewkes says.\n",
      "Well, my story surely would furnish out a surprising kind of novel, if\n",
      "it was to be well told.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Robert came up to me, just now, and begged me to eat something: I\n",
      "thanked him; but said, I could not eat. I bid him ask Mr. Colbrand to\n",
      "walk up; and he came; but neither of them would sit; nor put their hats\n",
      "on. What mockado is this, to such a poor soul as I! I asked them, if\n",
      "they were at liberty to tell me the truth of what they were to do with\n",
      "me? If not, I would not desire it.--They both said, Robin was ordered\n",
      "to carry me to my father's; and Mr. Colbrand was to leave me within ten\n",
      "miles, and then strike off for the other house, and wait till my master\n",
      "arrived there. They both spoke so solemnly, that I could not but believe\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when Robin went down, the other said, he had a letter to give me\n",
      "next day at noon, when we baited, as we were to do, at Mrs. Jewkes's\n",
      "relation's.--May I not, said I, beg the favour to see it to-night? He\n",
      "seemed so loath to deny me, that I have hopes I shall prevail on him by\n",
      "and by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, my dear father and mother, I have got the letter, on great\n",
      "promises of secrecy, and making no use of it. I will try if I can open\n",
      "it without breaking the seal, and will take a copy of it by and by; for\n",
      "Robin is in and out: there being hardly any room in this little house\n",

      "affection; nay, so much honour too, (which was all I had before doubted,\n",

      "you, that I shall never be able to think of any body in the world\n",
      "but him.--Presumption! you will say; and so it is: But love is not a\n",
      "voluntary thing: Love, did I say?--But come, I hope not:--At least it is\n",

      "this weakness.--But, to be sure, my dear sir, I will keep a longer time\n",
      "than a twelvemonth, as a true widow, for a compliment, and more than a\n",
      "compliment, to your ashes! O the dear word!--How kind, how moving,\n",

      "voice praying for me at your departure, and thanking me for my rebuke\n",

      "your opinions, how I should act. Should I go back, or should I\n",
      "not?--I doubt he has got too great hold in my heart, for me to be easy\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, I will, I think, trust in his generosity! Yet is it not too great\n",
      "a trust?--especially considering how I have been used!--But then that\n",
      "was while he avowed his bad designs; and now he gives great hope of\n",
      "his good ones. And I may be the means of making many happy, as well as\n",
      "myself, by placing a generous confidence in him.\n",
      "\n",

      "that! And would it not look as if I was prepossessed, as he calls it, if\n",
      "I don't oblige him; and as if it was a silly female piece of pride, to\n",
      "make him follow me to my father's; and as if I would use him hardly in\n",
      "my turn, for his having used me ill in his? Upon the whole, I resolved\n",
      "to obey him; and if he uses me ill afterwards, double will be his\n",
      "ungenerous guilt!--Though hard will be my lot, to have my credulity so\n",
      "justly blamable, as it will then seem. For, to be sure, the world, the\n",
      "wise world, that never is wrong itself, judges always by events. And if\n",
      "he should use me ill, then I shall be blamed for trusting him: If well,\n",
      "O then I did right, to be sure!--But how would my censurers act in\n",
      "my case, before the event justifies or condemns the action, is the\n",
      "question?\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I have no notion of obliging by halves; but of doing things with\n",
      "a grace, as one may say, where they are to be done; and so I wrote\n",
      "the desired letter to you, assuring you, that I had before me happier\n",
      "prospects than ever I had; and hoped all would end well: And that I\n",
      "begged you would send me, by the bearer, Mr. Thomas, my master's groom,\n",
      "those papers, which I had sent you by Mr. Williams's conveyance: For\n",
      "that they imported me much, for clearing up a point in my conduct, that\n",
      "my master was desirous to know, before he resolved to favour me, as he\n",
      "had intended.--But you will have that letter, before you can have this;\n",
      "for I would not send you this without the preceding; which now is in my\n",
      "master's hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, having given the letter to Mr. Thomas for him to carry to\n",
      "you, when he had baited and rested after his great fatigue, I sent for\n",
      "Monsieur Colbrand, and Robin, and gave to the former his letter; and\n",
      "when he had read it, I said, You see how things stand. I am resolved to\n",
      "return to our master; and as he is not so well as were to be wished, the\n",
      "more haste you make the better: and don't mind my fatigue, but consider\n",
      "only yourselves, and the horses. Robin, who guessed the matter, by his\n",
      "conversation with Thomas, (as I suppose,) said, God bless you, madam,\n",
      "and reward you, as your obligingness to my good master deserves; and may\n",
      "we all live to see you triumph over Mrs. Jewkes!\n",
      "\n",
      "I wondered to hear him say so; for I was always careful of exposing my\n",
      "master, or even that naughty woman, before the common servants. But yet\n",
      "I question whether Robin would have said this, if he had not guessed,\n",
      "by Thomas's message, and my resolving to return, that I might stand well\n",
      "with his master. So selfish are the hearts of poor mortals, that they\n",
      "are ready to change as favour goes!\n",
      "\n",
      "So they were not long getting ready; and I am just setting out, back\n",
      "again: and I hope I shall have no reason to repent it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robin put on very vehemently; and when we came to the little town, where\n",
      "we lay on Sunday night, he gave his horses a bait, and said, he would\n",
      "push for his master's that night, as it would be moon-light, if I should\n",
      "not be too much fatigued because there was no place between that and\n",
      "the town adjacent to his master's, fit to put up at, for the night. But\n",
      "Monsieur Colbrand's horse beginning to give way, made a doubt between\n",
      "them: wherefore I said, (hating to be on the road,) if it could be done,\n",
      "I should bear it well enough, I hoped; and that Monsieur Colbrand\n",
      "might leave his horse, when it failed, at some house, and come into the\n",
      "chariot. This pleased them both; and, about twelve miles short, he left\n",
      "the horse, and took off his spurs and holsters, etc. and, with abundance\n",
      "of ceremonial excuses, came into the chariot; and I sat the easier\n",
      "for it; for my bones ached sadly with the jolting, and so many miles\n",
      "travelling in so few hours, as I have done, from Sunday night, five\n",
      "o'clock. But, for all this, it was eleven o'clock at night, when we came\n",
      "to the village adjacent to my master's; and the horses began to be very\n",
      "much tired, and Robin too: but I said, It would be pity to put up only\n",
      "three miles short of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "So about one we reached the gate; but every body was a-bed. But one of\n",
      "the helpers got the keys from Mrs. Jewkes, and opened the gates; and the\n",
      "horses could hardly crawl into the stable. And I, when I went to get out\n",
      "of the chariot, fell down, and thought I had lost the use of my limbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes came down with her clothes huddled on, and lifted up her\n",
      "hands and eyes, at my return; but shewed more care of the horses than\n",
      "of me. By that time the two maids came; and I made shift to creep in, as\n",
      "well as I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems my poor master was very ill indeed, and had been upon the bed\n",
      "most part of the day; and Abraham (who succeeded John) sat up with him.\n",
      "And he was got into a fine sleep, and heard not the coach come in, nor\n",
      "the noise we made; for his chamber lies towards the garden,--on the\n",
      "other side of the house. Mrs. Jewkes said, He had a feverish complaint,\n",
      "and had been blooded; and, very prudently, ordered Abraham, when he\n",
      "awaked, not to tell him I was come, for fear of surprising him, and\n",
      "augmenting his fever; nor, indeed, to say any thing of me, till she\n",
      "herself broke it to him in the morning, as she should see how he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I went to bed with Mrs. Jewkes, after she had caused me to drink\n",
      "almost half a pint of burnt wine, made very rich and cordial, with\n",
      "spices; which I found very refreshing, and set me into a sleep I little\n",
      "hoped for.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuesday morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting up pretty early, I have written thus far, while Mrs. Jewkes lies\n",
      "snoring in bed, fetching up her last night's disturbance. I long for her\n",
      "rising, to know how my poor master does. 'Tis well for her she can sleep\n",
      "so purely. No love, but for herself, will ever break her rest, I am\n",
      "sure. I am deadly sore all over, as if I had been soundly beaten. I did\n",
      "not think I could have lived under such fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes, as soon as she got up, went to know how my master did, and\n",
      "he had had a good night; and, having drank plentifully of sack whey,\n",
      "had sweated much; so that his fever had abated considerably. She said\n",
      "to him, that he must not be surprised, and she would tell him news. He\n",
      "asked, What? And she said, I was come. He raised himself up in his bed;\n",
      "Can it be? said he--What, already!--She told him I came last night.\n",
      "Monsieur Colbrand coming to inquire of his health, he ordered him to\n",
      "draw near him, and was highly pleased with the account he gave him of\n",
      "the journey, my readiness to come back, and my willingness to reach\n",
      "home that night. And he said, Why, these tender fair ones, I think, bear\n",
      "fatigue better than us men. But she is very good, to give me such an\n",
      "instance of her readiness to oblige me. Pray, Mrs. Jewkes, said he, take\n",
      "great care of her health! and let her be a-bed all day. She told him I\n",
      "had been up these two hours. Ask her, said he, if she will be so good as\n",
      "to make me a visit: If she won't, I'll rise, and go to her. Indeed, sir,\n",
      "said she, you must be still; and I'll go to her. But don't urge her too\n",
      "much, said he, if she be unwilling.\n",
      "\n",
      "She came to me, and told me all the above; and I said, I would most\n",
      "willingly wait upon him; for, indeed, I longed to see him, and was much\n",
      "grieved he was so ill.--So I went down with her. Will she come? said\n",
      "he, as I entered the room. Yes, sir, said we; and she said, at the first\n",
      "word, Most willingly.--Sweet excellence! said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he saw me, he said, O my beloved Pamela! you have made me\n",
      "quite well. I'm concerned to return my acknowledgments to you in so\n",
      "unfit a place and manner; but will you give me your hand? I did, and\n",
      "he kissed it with great eagerness. Sir, said I, you do me too much\n",
      "honour!--I am sorry you are so ill.--I can't be ill, said he, while you\n",
      "are with me. I am very well already.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said he, and kissed my hand again, you shall not repent this\n",
      "goodness. My heart is too full of it to express myself as I ought. But\n",
      "I am sorry you have had such a fatiguing time of it.--Life is no life\n",
      "without you! If you had refused me, and yet I had hardly hopes you would\n",
      "oblige me, I should have had a severe fit of it, I believe; for I was\n",
      "taken very oddly, and knew not what to make of myself: but now I shall\n",
      "be well instantly. You need not, Mrs. Jewkes, added he, send for the\n",
      "doctor from Stamford, as we talked yesterday; for this lovely creature\n",
      "is my doctor, as her absence was my disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "He begged me to sit down by his bed-side, and asked me, if I had obliged\n",
      "him with sending for my former packet? I said I had, and hoped it would\n",
      "be brought. He said it was doubly kind.\n",

      "Pamela's obligingness in her return, I am sure we ought to leave her\n",
      "entirely at her own liberty; and pray, if she pleases to take a turn in\n",
      "our chariot, or in the garden, or to the town, or wherever she will,\n",
      "let her be left at liberty, and asked no questions; and do you do all in\n",

      "before you went, taken Williams's bond for the money; for how the poor\n",
      "man had behaved I can't tell, but he could get no bail; and if I have no\n",
      "fresh reason given me, perhaps I shall not exact the payment; and he has\n",

      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, I will not do any thing to disoblige you wilfully; and I am\n",

      "I durst say no more, though I wanted to plead for the poor gentleman;\n",
      "which, in gratitude, I thought I ought, when I could do him service. I\n",

      "incurred your displeasure, and that there should be any variance between\n",
      "your honour and her; I hope it was not on my account. He took out of\n",
      "his waistcoat pocket, as he sat in his gown, his letter-case, and said,\n",
      "Here, Pamela, read that when you go up stairs, and let me have your\n",

      "for that day; and if he was better in the morning, would take an airing\n",
      "in the chariot. And so I took my leave for the present, and went up\n",
      "to my closet, and read the letter he was pleased to put into my hands;\n",

      "it please you or not, my full mind. I have had some people with me,\n",
      "desiring me to interpose with you; and they have a greater regard for\n",
      "your honour, than, I am sorry to say it, you have yourself. Could I\n",
      "think, that a brother of mine would so meanly run away with my late dear\n",
      "mother's waiting-maid, and keep her a prisoner from all her friends, and\n",
      "to the disgrace of your own? But I thought, when you would not let the\n",
      "wench come to me on my mother's death, that you meant no good.--I blush\n",
      "for you, I'll assure you. The girl was an innocent, good girl; but I\n",
      "suppose that's over with her now, or soon will. What can you mean by\n",
      "this, let me ask you? Either you will have her for a kept mistress, or\n",
      "for a wife. If the former, there are enough to be had without ruining\n",
      "a poor wench that my mother loved, and who really was a very good girl:\n",
      "and of this you may be ashamed. As to the other, I dare say you don't\n",
      "think of it; but if you should, you would be utterly inexcusable.\n",
      "Consider, brother, that ours is no upstart family; but is as ancient\n",
      "as the best in the kingdom! and, for several hundreds of years, it has\n",
      "never been known, that the heirs of it have disgraced themselves by\n",
      "unequal matches: And you know you have been sought to by some of the\n",
      "best families in the nation, for your alliance. It might be well enough,\n",
      "if you were descended of a family of yesterday, or but a remove or two\n",
      "from the dirt you seem so fond of. But, let me tell you, that I, and all\n",
      "mine, will renounce you for ever, if you can descend so meanly; and I\n",
      "shall be ashamed to be called your sister. A handsome man, as you are,\n",
      "in your person; so happy in the gifts of your mind, that every body\n",
      "courts your company; and possessed of such a noble and clear estate; and\n",
      "very rich in money besides, left you by the best of fathers and mothers,\n",
      "with such ancient blood in your veins, untainted! for you to throw away\n",
      "yourself thus, is intolerable; and it would be very wicked in you to\n",
      "ruin the wench too. So that I beg you will restore her to her parents,\n",
      "and give her 100L. or so, to make her happy in some honest fellow of her\n",

      "first setting out he kissed me a little too often, that he did; and I\n",
      "was afraid of Robin's looking back, through the fore-glass, and people\n",
      "seeing us, as they passed; but he was exceedingly kind to me, in his\n",
      "words, as well. At last, he said,\n",
      "\n",

      "value of 3000L. more than her share came to by my father's will, when I\n",
      "entered upon my estate. And the woman, surely, was beside herself with\n",
      "passion and insolence, when she wrote me such a letter; for well she\n",
      "knew I would not bear it. But you must know, Pamela, that she is much\n",
      "incensed, that I will give no ear to a proposal of hers, of a\n",
      "daughter of my Lord ----, who, said he, neither in person, or mind, or\n",
      "acquirements, even with all her opportunities, is to be named in a day\n",
      "with my Pamela. But yet you see the plea, my girl, which I made to you\n",
      "before, of the pride of condition, and the world's censure, which, I\n",
      "own, sticks a little too close with me still: for a woman shines not\n",
      "forth to the public as man; and the world sees not your excellencies\n",
      "and perfections: If it did, I should entirely stand acquitted by the\n",
      "severest censures. But it will be taken in the lump; that here is\n",
      "Mr. B----, with such and such an estate, has married his mother's\n",
      "waiting-maid: not considering there is not a lady in the kingdom that\n",
      "can out-do her, or better support the condition to which she will be\n",
      "raised, if I should marry her. And, said he, putting his arm round me,\n",
      "and again kissing me, I pity my dear girl too, for her part in this\n",
      "censure; for, here will she have to combat the pride and slights of the\n",
      "neighbouring gentry all around us. Sister Davers, you see, will never\n",
      "be reconciled to you. The other ladies will not visit you; and you\n",

      "Won't these be cutting things to my fair-one? For, as to me, I shall\n",
      "have nothing to do, but, with a good estate in possession, to brazen out\n",
      "the matter of my former pleasantry on this subject, with my companions\n",
      "of the chase, the green, and the assemblee; stand their rude jests for\n",
      "once or twice, and my fortune will create me always respect enough, I\n",
      "warrant you. But, I say, what will my poor girl do, as to her part, with\n",
      "her own sex? For some company you must keep. My station will not admit\n",
      "it to be with my servants; and the ladies will fly your acquaintance;\n",
      "and still, though my wife, will treat you as my mother's\n",
      "waiting-maid.--What says my girl to this?\n",
      "\n",
      "You may well guess, my dear father and mother, how transporting these\n",

      "I had the harmony of the spheres all around me; and every word that\n",
      "dropped from his lips was as sweet as the honey of Hybla to me.--Oh!\n",
      "sir, said I, how inexpressibly kind and good is all this! Your poor\n",
      "servant has a much greater struggle than this to go through, a more\n",
      "knotty difficulty to overcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is that? said he, a little impatiently: I will not forgive your\n",
      "doubts now.--No, sir, said I, I cannot doubt; but it is, how I shall\n",
      "support, how I shall deserve your goodness to me.--Dear girl! said he,\n",
      "and hugged me to his breast, I was afraid you would have made me angry\n",
      "again; but that I would not be, because I see you have a grateful heart;\n",
      "and this your kind and cheerful return, after such cruel usage as you\n",
      "had experienced in my house, enough to make you detest the place, has\n",
      "made me resolve to bear any thing in you, but doubts of my honour, at a\n",
      "time when I am pouring out my soul, with a true and affectionate ardour,\n",
      "before you.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, good sir, said I, my greatest concern will be for the rude jests\n",
      "you will have yourself to encounter with, for thus stooping beneath\n",
      "yourself. For, as to me, considering my lowly estate, and little merit,\n",
      "even the slights and reflections of the ladies will be an honour to me:\n",
      "and I shall have the pride to place more than half their ill will to\n",
      "their envy at my happiness. And if I can, by the most cheerful duty, and\n",
      "resigned obedience, have the pleasure to be agreeable to you, I shall\n",
      "think myself but too happy, let the world say what it will.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, You are very good, my dearest girl! But how will you bestow\n",
      "your time, when you will have no visits to receive or pay? No parties of\n",
      "pleasure to join in? No card-tables to employ your winter evenings; and\n",
      "even, as the taste is, half the day, summer and winter? And you have\n",
      "often played with my mother, too, and so know how to perform a part\n",
      "there, as well as in the other diversions: and I'll assure you, my girl,\n",
      "I shall not desire you to live without such amusements, as my wife might\n",
      "expect, were I to marry a lady of the first quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "O, sir, said I, you are all goodness! How shall I bear it?--But do you\n",
      "think, sir, in such a family as yours, a person whom you shall honour\n",
      "with the name of mistress of it, will not find useful employments for\n",
      "her time, without looking abroad for any others?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, sir, if you will give me leave, I will myself look\n",
      "into such parts of the family economy, as may not be beneath the rank\n",
      "to which I shall have the honour of being exalted, if any such there\n",
      "can be; and this, I hope, without incurring the ill will of any honest\n",
      "servant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, sir, I will ease you of as much of your family accounts, as I\n",
      "possibly can, when I have convinced you that I am to be trusted with\n",
      "them; and you know, sir, my late good lady made me her treasurer, her\n",
      "almoner, and every thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, sir, if I must needs be visiting or visited, and the ladies won't\n",
      "honour me so much, or even if they would now and then, I will visit, if\n",
      "your goodness will allow me so to do, the sick poor in the neighbourhood\n",
      "around you; and administer to their wants and necessities, in such\n",
      "matters as may not be hurtful to your estate, but comfortable to them;\n",
      "and entail upon you their blessings, and their prayers for your dear\n",
      "health and welfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I will assist your housekeeper, as I used to do, in the making\n",
      "jellies, comfits, sweetmeats, marmalades, cordials; and to pot, and\n",

      "the fine linen of it for yourself and me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, sir, if you will sometimes indulge me with your company, I will\n",
      "take an airing in your chariot now and then: and when you shall return\n",
      "home from your diversions on the green, or from the chase, or where\n",
      "you shall please to go, I shall have the pleasure of receiving you with\n",
      "duty, and a cheerful delight; and, in your absence, count the moments\n",
      "till you return; and you will, may be, fill up some part of my time, the\n",

      "O, said he, what pleasure you give me in this sweet foretaste of my\n",

      "to hint; and which I will no otherwise touch upon, lest it should\n",
      "seem, to your nicety, to detract from the present purity of my good\n",
      "intentions, than to say, I hope to have superadded to all these, such an\n",

      "\n",
      "He was pleased to add another charming reflection, which shewed me the\n",

      "life; a flame to which I was a stranger; and which commenced for you in\n",
      "the garden; though you, unkindly, by your unseasonable doubts, nipped\n",
      "the opening bud, while it was too tender to bear the cold blasts of\n",
      "slight or negligence. And I know more sincere joy and satisfaction in\n",
      "this sweet hour's conversation with you, than all the guilty tumults\n",
      "of my former passion ever did, or (had even my attempts succeeded) ever\n",
      "could have afforded me.\n",
      "\n",
      "O, sir, said I, expect not words from your poor servant, equal to these\n",
      "most generous professions. Both the means, and the will, I now see, are\n",
      "given to you, to lay me under an everlasting obligation. How happy\n",
      "shall I be, if, though I cannot be worthy of all this goodness and\n",
      "condescension, I can prove myself not entirely unworthy of it! But I\n",
      "can only answer for a grateful heart; and if ever I give you cause,\n",
      "wilfully, (and you will generously allow for involuntary imperfections,)\n",
      "to be disgusted with me, may I be an outcast from your house and favour,\n",
      "and as much repudiated, as if the law had divorced me from you!\n",
      "\n",
      "But sir, continued I, though I was so unseasonable as I was in the\n",
      "garden, you would, I flatter myself, had you then heard me, have\n",
      "pardoned my imprudence, and owned I had some cause to fear, and to wish\n",
      "to be with my poor father and mother: and this I the rather say,\n",
      "that you should not think me capable of returning insolence for your\n",
      "goodness; or appearing foolishly ungrateful to you, when you was so kind\n",
      "to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, Pamela, said he, you gave me great uneasiness; for I love you\n",
      "too well not to be jealous of the least appearance of your indifference\n",
      "to me, or preference to any other person, not excepting your parents\n",
      "themselves. This made me resolve not to hear you; for I had not got\n",
      "over my reluctance to marriage; and a little weight, you know, turns the\n",
      "scale, when it hangs in an equal balance. But yet, you see, that though\n",
      "I could part with you, while my anger held, yet the regard I had then\n",
      "newly professed for your virtue, made me resolve not to offer to violate\n",
      "it; and you have seen likewise, that the painful struggle I underwent\n",
      "when I began to reflect, and to read your moving journal, between my\n",
      "desire to recall you, and my doubt whether you would return, (though yet\n",
      "I resolved not to force you to it,) had like to have cost me a severe\n",
      "illness: but your kind and cheerful return has dispelled all my fears,\n",
      "and given me hope, that I am not indifferent to you; and you see how\n",
      "your presence has chased away my illness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bless God for it, said I; but since you are so good as to encourage\n",
      "me, and will not despise my weakness, I will acknowledge, that I\n",
      "suffered more than I could have imagined, till I experienced it, in\n",
      "being banished your presence in so much anger; and the more still was I\n",
      "affected, when you answered the wicked Mrs. Jewkes so generously in\n",
      "my favour, at my leaving your house. For this, sir, awakened all my\n",
      "reverence for you; and you saw I could not forbear, not knowing what I\n",
      "did, to break boldly in upon you, and acknowledge your goodness on my\n",
      "knees. 'Tis true, my dear Pamela, said he, we have sufficiently tortured\n",
      "one another; and the only comfort that can result from it, will be,\n",
      "reflecting upon the matter coolly and with pleasure, when all these\n",
      "storms are overblown, (as I hope they now are,) and we sit together\n",
      "secured in each other's good opinion, recounting the uncommon gradations\n",
      "by which we have ascended to the summit of that felicity, which I hope\n",
      "we shall shortly arrive at.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime, said the good gentleman, let me hear what my dear girl would\n",
      "have said in her justification, could I have trusted myself with her, as\n",
      "to her fears, and the reason of her wishing herself from me, at a time\n",
      "that I had begun to shew my fondness for her, in a manner that I thought\n",
      "would have been agreeable to her and virtue.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pulled out of my pocket the gipsy letter; but I said, before I shewed\n",
      "it to him, I have this letter, sir, to shew you, as what, I believe, you\n",
      "will allow must have given me the greatest disturbance: but, first, as\n",
      "I know not who is the writer, and it seems to be in a disguised hand, I\n",
      "would beg it as a favour, that, if you guess who it is, which I cannot,\n",
      "it may not turn to their prejudice, because it was written, very\n",
      "probably, with no other view, than to serve me.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took it, and read it. And it being signed Somebody, he said, Yes,\n",
      "this is indeed from Somebody; and, disguised as the hand is, I know the\n",
      "writer: Don't you see, by the setness of some of these letters, and a\n",
      "little secretary cut here and there, especially in that c, and that r,\n",
      "that it is the hand of a person bred in the law-way? Why, Pamela, said\n",
      "he, 'tis old Longman's hand: an officious rascal as he is!--But I have\n",
      "done with him. O sir, said I, it would be too insolent in me to offer\n",
      "(so much am I myself overwhelmed with your goodness,) to defend any body\n",
      "that you are angry with: Yet, sir, so far as they have incurred your\n",
      "displeasure for my sake, and for no other want of duty or respect, I\n",
      "could wish--But I dare not say more.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, said he, as to the letter and the information it contains: Let me\n",
      "know, Pamela, when you received this? On the Friday, sir, said I, that\n",
      "you were gone to the wedding at Stamford.--How could it be conveyed\n",
      "to you, said he, unknown to Mrs. Jewkes, when I gave her such a strict\n",
      "charge to attend you, and you had promised me, that you would not throw\n",
      "yourself in the way of such intelligence? For, said he, when I went to\n",
      "Stamford, I knew, from a private intimation given me, that there would\n",
      "be an attempt made to see you, or give you a letter, by somebody, if not\n",
      "to get you away; but was not certain from what quarter, whether from my\n",
      "sister Davers, Mrs. Jervis, Mr. Longman, or John Arnold, or your father;\n",
      "and as I was then but struggling with myself, whether to give way to my\n",
      "honourable inclinations, or to free you, and let you go to your father,\n",
      "that I might avoid the danger I found myself in of the former; (for I\n",
      "had absolutely resolved never to wound again even your ears with any\n",
      "proposals of a contrary nature;) that was the reason I desired you to\n",
      "permit Mrs. Jewkes to be so much on her guard till I came back, when I\n",
      "thought I should have decided this disputed point within myself, between\n",
      "my pride and my inclinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, good sir, said I, accounts well to me for your conduct in that\n",
      "case, and for what you said to me and Mrs. Jewkes on that occasion: And\n",
      "I see more and more how much I may depend upon your honour and goodness\n",
      "to me.--But I will tell you all the truth. And then I recounted to him\n",
      "the whole affair of the gipsy, and how the letter was put among the\n",
      "loose grass, etc. And he said, The man who thinks a thousand dragons\n",
      "sufficient to watch a woman, when her inclination takes a contrary bent,\n",
      "will find all too little; and she will engage the stones in the\n",
      "street, or the grass in the field, to act for her, and help on her\n",
      "correspondence. If the mind, said he, be not engaged, I see there is\n",
      "hardly any confinement sufficient for the body; and you have told me a\n",
      "very pretty story; and, as you never gave me any reason to question your\n",
      "veracity, even in your severest trials, I make no doubt of the truth\n",
      "of what you have now mentioned: and I will, in my turn, give you such a\n",
      "proof of mine, that you shall find it carry a conviction with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must know, then, my Pamela, that I had actually formed such a\n",
      "project, so well informed was this old rascally Somebody! and the time\n",
      "was fixed for the very person described in this letter to be here; and I\n",
      "had thought he should have read some part of the ceremony (as little as\n",
      "was possible, to deceive you) in my chamber; and so I hoped to have you\n",
      "mine upon terms that then would have been much more agreeable to me than\n",
      "real matrimony. And I did not in haste intend you the mortification of\n",
      "being undeceived; so that we might have lived for years, perhaps, very\n",
      "lovingly together; and I had, at the same time, been at liberty to\n",
      "confirm or abrogate it as I pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "O sir, said I, I am out of breath with the thoughts of my danger! But\n",
      "what good angel prevented the execution of this deep-laid design?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, your good angel, Pamela, said he; for when I began to consider,\n",
      "that it would have made you miserable, and me not happy; that if you\n",
      "should have a dear little one, it would be out of my own power to\n",
      "legitimate it, if I should wish it to inherit my estate; and that, as I\n",
      "am almost the last of my family, and most of what I possess must\n",
      "descend to a strange line, and disagreeable and unworthy persons;\n",
      "notwithstanding that I might, in this case, have issue of my own body;\n",
      "when I further considered your untainted virtue, what dangers and\n",
      "trials you had undergone by my means, and what a world of troubles I had\n",
      "involved you in, only because you were beautiful and virtuous, which\n",
      "had excited all my passion for you; and reflected also upon your tried\n",
      "prudence and truth! I, though I doubted not effecting this my last plot,\n",
      "resolved to overcome myself; and, however I might suffer in struggling\n",
      "with my affection for you, to part with you, rather than to betray\n",
      "you under so black a veil. Besides, said he, I remember how much I had\n",
      "exclaimed against and censured an action of this kind, that had been\n",
      "attributed to one of the first men of the law, and of the kingdom, as he\n",
      "afterwards became; and that it was but treading in a path that another\n",
      "had marked out for me; and, as I was assured, with no great satisfaction\n",
      "to himself, when he came to reflect; my foolish pride was a little\n",
      "piqued with this, because I loved to be, if I went out of the way, my\n",
      "own original, as I may call it. On all these considerations it was, that\n",
      "I rejected this project, and sent word to the person, that I had better\n",
      "considered of the matter, and would not have him come, till he\n",
      "heard further from me: And, in this suspense I suppose, some of your\n",
      "confederates, Pamela, (for we have been a couple of plotters, though\n",
      "your virtue and merit have procured you faithful friends and partisans,\n",
      "which my money and promises could hardly do,) one way or other got\n",
      "knowledge of it, and gave you this notice; but, perhaps, it would have\n",
      "come too late, had not your white angel got the better of my black one,\n",
      "and inspired me with resolutions to abandon the project, just as it\n",
      "was to have been put into execution. But yet I own, that, from these\n",
      "appearances, you were but too well justified in your fears, on this odd\n",
      "way of coming at this intelligence; and I have only one thing to blame\n",
      "you for, that though I was resolved not to hear you in your own defence,\n",
      "yet, as you have so ready a talent at your pen, you might have cleared\n",
      "your part of this matter up to me by a line or two; and when I had known\n",
      "what seeming good grounds you had for pouring cold water on a young\n",
      "flame, that was just then rising to an honourable expansion, should\n",
      "not have imputed it, as I was apt to do, to unseasonable insult for my\n",
      "tenderness to you, on one hand; to perverse nicety, on the other; or to\n",
      "(what I was most alarmed by, and concerned for) prepossession for some\n",
      "other person: And this would have saved us both much fatigue, I of mind,\n",
      "you of body.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, indeed, sir, said I, of mind too; and I could not better manifest\n",
      "this, than by the cheerfulness with which I obeyed your recalling me to\n",
      "your presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ay, that, my dear Pamela, said he, and clasped me in his arms, was the\n",
      "kind, the inexpressibly kind action, that has rivetted my affections\n",
      "to you, and obliges me, in this free and unreserved manner, to pour my\n",
      "whole soul into your bosom.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, I had the less merit in this my return, because I was driven, by\n",
      "an irresistible impulse to it; and could not help it, if I would.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, said he, (and honoured me by kissing my hand,) is engaging,\n",
      "indeed; if I may hope, that my Pamela's gentle inclination for her\n",
      "persecutor was the strongest motive to her return; and I so much value a\n",
      "voluntary love in the person I would wish for my wife, that I would have\n",
      "even prudence and interest hardly named in comparison with it: And can\n",
      "you return me sincerely the honest compliment I now make you?--In\n",
      "the choice I have made, it is impossible I should have any view to my\n",
      "interest. Love, true love, is the only motive by which I am induced. And\n",
      "were I not what I am, could you give me the preference to any other you\n",
      "know in the world, notwithstanding what has passed between us? Why,\n",
      "said I, should your so much obliged Pamela refuse to answer this kind\n",
      "question? Cruel as I have thought you, and dangerous as your views to\n",
      "my honesty have been; you, sir, are the only person living that ever was\n",
      "more than indifferent to me: and before I knew this to be what I blush\n",
      "now to call it, I could not hate you, or wish you ill, though, from my\n",
      "soul, the attempts you made were shocking, and most distasteful to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am satisfied, my Pamela, said he; nor shall I want to see those papers\n",
      "that you have kindly written for to your father; though I still wish to\n",
      "see them too, for the sake of the sweet manner in which you relate what\n",
      "has passed, and to have before me the whole series of your sufferings,\n",
      "that I may learn what degree of kindness may be sufficient to recompense\n",
      "you for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this manner, my dear father and mother, did your happy daughter find\n",
      "herself blessed by her generous master! An ample recompense for all her\n",
      "sufferings did I think this sweet conversation only. A hundred tender\n",
      "things he expressed besides, that though they never can escape my\n",
      "memory, yet would be too tedious to write down. Oh, how I blessed God,\n",
      "and, I hope, ever shall, for all his gracious favours to his unworthy\n",
      "handmaid! What a happy change is this! And who knows but my kind, my\n",
      "generous master, may put it in my power, when he shall see me not quite\n",
      "unworthy of it, to be a means, without injuring him, to dispense around\n",
      "me, to many persons, the happy influences of the condition to which\n",
      "I shall be, by his kind favour, exalted? Doubly blest shall I be, in\n",
      "particular, if I can return the hundredth part of the obligations I owe\n",
      "to such honest good parents, to whose pious instructions and examples,\n",
      "under God, I owe all my present happiness, and future prospects.--O\n",
      "the joy that fills my mind on these proud hopes! on these delightful\n",
      "prospects!--It is too mighty for me, and I must sit down to ponder all\n",
      "these things, and to admire and bless the goodness of that Providence,\n",
      "which has, through so many intricate mazes, made me tread the paths of\n",
      "innocence, and so amply rewarded me for what it has itself enabled me to\n",
      "do! All glory to God alone be ever given for it, by your poor enraptured\n",
      "daughter!----\n",
      "\n",
      "I will now continue my most pleasing relation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the chariot was returning home from this sweet airing, he said, From\n",
      "all that has passed between us in this pleasing turn, my Pamela will\n",
      "see, and will believe, that the trials of her virtue are all over from\n",
      "me: But, perhaps, there will be some few yet to come of her patience and\n",
      "humility. For I have, at the earnest importunity of Lady Darnford, and\n",
      "her daughters, promised them a sight of my beloved girl: And so I intend\n",
      "to have their whole family, and Lady Jones, and Mrs. Peters's family, to\n",
      "dine with me once in a few days. And, since I believe you would hardly\n",
      "choose, at present, to grace the table on the occasion, till you can do\n",
      "it in your own right, I should be glad you would not refuse coming down\n",
      "to us if I should desire it; for I would preface our nuptials, said the\n",

      "of your merits: and to see you, and your sweet manner, will be enough\n",
      "for that purpose; and so, by degrees, prepare my neighbours for what\n",
      "is to follow: And they already have your character from me, and are\n",
      "disposed to admire you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, after all that has passed, I should be unworthy, if I could\n",

      "I shall behave in such company, weighed down with a sense of\n",
      "your obligations on one side, and my own unworthiness, with their\n",

      "nevertheless, I should be best pleased to wear always this humble garb,\n",
      "till you, for your own sake, shall order it otherwise: for, oh,\n",
      "sir, said I, I hope it will be always my pride to glory most in your\n",
      "goodness! and it will be a pleasure to me to shew every one, that, with\n",
      "respect to my happiness in this life, I am entirely the work of your\n",

      "superior to those of all thy sex!--I might have addressed a hundred fine\n",

      "attribute it to my vanity; for I do assure you, I think I ought rather\n",
      "to be more humble, as I am more obliged: for it must be always a sign of\n",
      "a poor condition, to receive obligations one cannot repay; as it is of\n",
      "a rich mind, when it can confer them without expecting or needing a\n",
      "return. It is, on one side, the state of the human creature, compared,\n",
      "on the other, to the Creator; and so, with due deference, may his\n",

      "out of the chariot, and to the parlour, with the same goodness, that\n",
      "he shewed when he put me into it, before several of the servants. Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes came to inquire how he did. Quite well, Mrs. Jewkes, said he;\n",
      "quite well: I thank God, and this good girl, for it!--I am glad of it,\n",

      "of you!--No, but the better, Mrs. Jewkes, said he; you have much obliged\n",
      "me by both.\n",
      "\n",

      "you. We have had a quite different subject to talk of; and I hope she\n",
      "will forgive us both: You especially she must; because you have\n",
      "done nothing but by my orders. But I only mean, that the necessary\n",
      "consequence of those orders has been very grievous to my Pamela: And now\n",
      "comes our part to make her amends, if we can.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said she, I always said to madam (as she called me), that you was\n",
      "very good, and very forgiving. No, said he, I have been stark naught;\n",
      "and it is she, I hope, will be very forgiving. But all this preamble is\n",
      "to tell you, Mrs. Jewkes, that now I desire you'll study to oblige her,\n",
      "as much as (to obey me) you was forced to disoblige her before. And\n",
      "you'll remember, that in every thing she is to be her own mistress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, said she, and mine too, I suppose, sir? Ay, said the generous\n",
      "gentleman, I believe it will be so in a little time.--Then, said she,\n",
      "I know how it will go with me! And so put her handkerchief to her\n",
      "eyes.--Pamela, said my master, comfort poor Mrs. Jewkes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was very generous, already to seem to put her in my power: and I\n",
      "took her by the hand, and said, I shall never take upon me, Mrs. Jewkes,\n",
      "to make a bad use of any opportunities that may be put into my hands by\n",
      "my generous master; nor shall I ever wish to do you any disservice, if\n",
      "I might: for I shall consider, that what you have done, was in obedience\n",
      "to a will which it will become me also to submit to and so, if the\n",
      "effects of our obedience may be different, yet as they proceed from one\n",
      "cause, that must be always reverenced by me.\n",
      "\n",
      "See there, Mrs. Jewkes, said my master, we are both in generous hands;\n",
      "and indeed, if Pamela did not pardon you, I should think she but half\n",
      "forgave me, because you acted by my instructions.--Well, said she,\n",
      "God bless you both together, since it must be so; and I will double my\n",

      "promising things, so soothing to the vanity of my years and sex. But\n",
      "even to this hour can I pray, that God would remove from me all these\n",
      "delightful prospects, if they were likely so to corrupt my mind, as to\n",

      "Persons that doubt themselves, said he, seldom do amiss: And if there\n",
      "was any fear of what you say, you could not have it in your thoughts:\n",
      "for none but the presumptuous, the conceited, and the thoughtless, err\n",
      "capitally. But, nevertheless, said he, I have such an opinion of your\n",

      "you that do it.\n",
      "\n",

      "all before it on the surface of its waters!\n",
      "\n",

      "God, who had thus changed my distress to happiness, and so abundantly\n",
      "rewarded me for all the sufferings I had passed through.--And oh, how\n",
      "light, how very light, do all those sufferings now appear, which then\n",
      "my repining mind made so grievous to me!--Hence, in every state of life,\n",
      "and in all the changes and chances of it, for the future, will I trust\n",
      "in Providence, who knows what is best for us, and frequently turns the\n",

      "night; and then stepped up to me, and, seeing me with pen and ink\n",

      "Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "This morning my master came up to me, and talked with me on various\n",
      "subjects, for a good while together, in the most kind manner. Among\n",
      "other things, he asked me, if I chose to order any new clothes against\n",
      "my marriage. (O how my heart flutters when he mentions this subject so\n",
      "freely!) I said, I left every thing to his good pleasure, only repeated\n",
      "my request, for the reasons aforegiven, that I might not be too fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, I think, my dear, it shall be very private: I hope you are not\n",
      "afraid of a sham-marriage; and pray get the service by heart, that you\n",
      "may see nothing is omitted. I glowed between shame and delight. O how I\n",
      "felt my cheeks burn!\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, I feared nothing, I apprehended nothing, but my own\n",
      "unworthiness. Said he, I think it shall be done within these fourteen\n",
      "days, from this day, at this house. O how I trembled! but not with\n",
      "grief, you may believe--What says my girl? Have you to object against\n",
      "any day of the next fourteen: because my affairs require me to go to my\n",
      "other house, and I think not to stir from this till I am happy with you?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no will but yours, said I (all glowing like the fire, as I could\n",
      "feel:) But, sir, did you say in the house? Ay, said he; for I care not\n",
      "how privately it be done; and it must be very public if we go to church.\n",
      "It is a holy rite, sir, said I; and would be better, methinks, in a holy\n",
      "place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see (said he, most kindly) my lovely maid's confusion; and your\n",
      "trembling tenderness shews I ought to oblige you all I may. Therefore\n",
      "I will order my own little chapel, which has not been used for two\n",
      "generations, for any thing but a lumber-room, because our family seldom\n",
      "resided here long together, to be cleared and cleaned, and got ready for\n",
      "the ceremony, if you dislike your own chamber or mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, that will be better than the chamber, and I hope it will\n",
      "never be lumbered again, but kept to the use for which, as I presume, it\n",
      "has been consecrated. O yes, said he, it has been consecrated, and that\n",
      "several ages ago, in my great great grandfather's time, who built that\n",
      "and the good old house together.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now, my good girl, if I do not too much add to your sweet confusion,\n",

      "\n",
      "In the second, if you please, sir, said I.--As you please, said he most\n",
      "kindly; but I should thank you, Pamela, if you would choose the first.\n",
      "I'd rather, sir, if you please, said I, have the second. Well, said he,\n",

      "\n",
      "Pray sir, said I, since you embolden me to talk on this important\n",

      "happiness?--You may, said he; but charge them to keep it secret, till\n",
      "you or I direct the contrary. And I told you, I would see no more of\n",
      "your papers; but I meant, I would not without your consent: but if you\n",
      "will shew them to me (and now I have no other motive for my curiosity,\n",

      "If, sir, said I, you will be pleased to let me write over again one\n",

      "for your perusal. What is that? said he: though I cannot consent to it\n",
      "beforehand: for I more desire to see them, because they are your\n",
      "true sentiments at the time, and because they were not written for my\n",
      "perusal. Sir, said I, what I am loath you should see, are very severe\n",
      "reflections on the letter I received by the gipsy, when I apprehended\n",
      "your design of the sham-marriage; though there are other things I would\n",
      "not have you see; but that is the worst. It can't be worse, said he, my\n",
      "dear sauce-box, than I have seen already; and I will allow your treating\n",
      "me in ever so black a manner, on that occasion, because it must have a\n",
      "very black appearance to you.--Well, sir, said I, I think I will obey\n",
      "you before night. But don't alter a word, said he. I won't, sir, replied\n",
      "I, since you order it.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we were talking, Mrs. Jewkes came up, and said Thomas was\n",
      "returned. O, said my master, let him bring up the papers: for he hoped,\n",
      "and so did I, that you had sent them by him. But it was a great balk,\n",
      "when he came up and said, Sir, Mr. Andrews did not care to deliver them;\n",
      "and would have it, that his daughter was forced to write that letter\n",
      "to him: and, indeed, sir, said he, the old gentleman took on sadly, and\n",
      "would have it that his daughter was undone, or else, he said, she would\n",
      "not have turned back, when on her way, (as I told him she did, said\n",
      "Thomas,) instead of coming to them. I began to be afraid now that all\n",
      "would be bad for me again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Tom, said he, don't mince the matter; tell me, before Mrs.\n",
      "Andrews, what they said. Why, sir, both he and Goody Andrews, after\n",
      "they had conferred together upon your letter, madam, came out, weeping\n",
      "bitterly, that grieved my very heart; and they said, Now all was over\n",
      "with their poor daughter; and either she had written that letter by\n",
      "compulsion, or had yielded to your honour; so they said; and was, or\n",
      "would be ruined!\n",
      "\n",
      "My master seemed vexed, as I feared. And I said, Pray, sir, be so good\n",
      "as to excuse the fears of my honest parents. They cannot know your\n",
      "goodness to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so (said he, without answering me,) they refused to deliver the\n",
      "papers? Yes, and please your honour, said Thomas, though I told them,\n",
      "that you, madam, of your own accord, on a letter I had brought you, very\n",
      "cheerfully wrote what I carried: But the old gentleman said, Why, wife,\n",
      "there are in these papers twenty things nobody should see but ourselves,\n",
      "and especially not the 'squire. O the poor girl has had so many\n",
      "stratagems to struggle with! and now, at last, she has met with one that\n",
      "has been too hard for her. And can it be possible for us to account for\n",
      "her setting out to come to us, and in such post haste, and, when she had\n",
      "got above half-way, to send us this letter, and to go back again of her\n",
      "own accord, as you say; when we know that all her delight would have\n",
      "been to come to us and to escape from the perils she had been so long\n",
      "contending with? And then, and please your honour, he said, he could not\n",
      "bear this; for his daughter was ruined, to be sure, before now. And so,\n",
      "said Thomas, the good old couple sat themselves down, and, hand-in-hand,\n",
      "leaning upon each other's shoulder, did nothing but lament.--I was\n",
      "piteously grieved, said he; but all I could say could not comfort them;\n",
      "nor would they give me the papers; though I told them I should deliver\n",
      "them only to Mrs. Andrews herself. And so, and please your honour, I was\n",
      "forced to come away without them.\n",
      "\n",
      "My good master saw me all bathed in tears at this description of your\n",
      "distress and fears for me; and he said, I would not have you take on\n",
      "so. I am not angry with your father in the main; he is a good man; and\n",
      "I would have you write out of hand, and it shall be sent by the post to\n",
      "Mr. Atkins, who lives within two miles of your father, and I'll enclose\n",
      "it in a cover of mine, in which I'll desire Mr. Atkins, the moment it\n",
      "comes to his hand, to convey it safely to your father or mother; and say\n",
      "nothing of their sending their papers, that it may not make them uneasy;\n",
      "for I want not now to see them on any other score than that of mere\n",
      "curiosity; and that will do at any time. And so saying, he saluted me\n",
      "before Thomas, and with his own handkerchief wiped my eyes; and said to\n",
      "Thomas, The good old folks are not to be blamed in the main. They don't\n",
      "know my honourable intentions by their dear daughter; who, Tom, will, in\n",
      "a little time, be your mistress; though I shall keep the matter private\n",
      "some days, and would not have it spoken of by my servants out of my\n",
      "house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thomas said, God bless your honour! You know best. And I said, O, sir,\n",
      "you are all goodness!--How kind is this, to forgive the disappointment,\n",
      "instead of being angry, as I feared you would! Thomas then withdrew. And\n",
      "my master said, I need not remind you of writing out of hand, to make\n",
      "the good folks easy: and I will leave you to yourself for that purpose;\n",
      "only send me down such of your papers, as you are willing I should see,\n",
      "with which I shall entertain myself for an hour or two. But, one thing,\n",
      "added he, I forgot to tell you: The neighbouring gentry I mentioned\n",
      "will be here tomorrow to dine with me, and I have ordered Mrs. Jewkes to\n",
      "prepare for them. And must I, sir, said I, be shewn to them? O yes, said\n",
      "he; that's the chief reason of their coming. And you'll see nobody equal\n",
      "to yourself: don't be concerned.\n",
      "\n",
      "I opened my papers, as soon as my master had left me; and laid out those\n",
      "beginning on the Thursday morning he set out for Stamford, 'with\n",
      "the morning visit he made me before I was up, and the injunctions of\n",
      "watchfulness, etc. to Mrs. Jewkes; the next day's gipsy affair, and my\n",

      "the dangers I had escaped and the troubles I had undergone. And how I\n",
      "unseasonably, in the midst of his goodness, expressed my desire of being\n",
      "sent to you, having the intelligence of a sham-marriage, from the gipsy,\n",
      "in my thoughts. How this enraged him, and made him turn me that very\n",
      "Sunday out of his house, and send me on my way to you. The particulars\n",
      "of my journey, and my grief at parting with him; and my free\n",
      "acknowledgment to you, that I found, unknown to myself, I had begun to\n",
      "love him, and could not help it. His sending after me, to beg my return;\n",
      "but yet generously leaving me at my liberty, when he might have forced\n",
      "me to return whether I was willing or not. My resolution to oblige him,\n",
      "and fatiguing journey back. My concern for his illness on my return. His\n",
      "kind reception of me, and shewing me his sister Davers's angry\n",
      "letter, against his behaviour to me, desiring him to set me free, and\n",
      "threatening to renounce him as a brother, if he should degrade himself\n",
      "by marrying me. My serious reflections on this letter, etc.' (all which,\n",
      "I hope, with the others, you will shortly see.) And this carried matters\n",
      "down to Tuesday night last.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that followed was so kind on his side, being our chariot conference,\n",
      "as above, on Wednesday morning, and how good he has been ever since,\n",
      "that I thought I would go no further; for I was a little ashamed to be\n",
      "so very open on that tender and most grateful subject; though his great\n",
      "goodness to me deserves all the acknowledgments I can possibly make.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when I had looked these out, I carried them down myself into the\n",
      "parlour to him; and said, putting them into his hands, Your allowances,\n",
      "good sir, as heretofore; and if I have been too open and free in my\n",
      "reflections or declarations, let my fears on one side, and my sincerity\n",
      "on the other, be my excuse. You are very obliging, my good girl, said\n",
      "he. You have nothing to apprehend from my thoughts, any more than from\n",
      "my actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I went up, and wrote the letter to you, briefly acquainting you\n",
      "with my present happiness, and my master's goodness, and expressing the\n",
      "gratitude of heart, which I owe to the kindest gentleman in the world,\n",
      "and assuring you, that I should soon have the pleasure of sending back\n",
      "to you, not only those papers, but all that succeeded them to this time,\n",
      "as I know you delight to amuse yourself in your leisure hours with my\n",
      "scribble: And I said, carrying it down to my master, before I sealed it,\n",
      "Will you please, sir, to take the trouble of reading what I write to my\n",
      "dear parents? Thank you, Pamela, said he, and set me on his knee, while\n",
      "he read it; and seemed much pleased with it; and giving it me again, You\n",
      "are very happy, said he, my beloved girl, in your style and expressions:\n",
      "and the affectionate things you say of me are inexpressibly obliging;\n",
      "and again, with this kiss, said he, do I confirm for truth all that you\n",
      "have promised for my intentions in this letter.--O what halcyon days are\n",
      "these! God continue them!--A change would kill me quite.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went out in his chariot in the afternoon; and in the evening\n",
      "returned, and sent me word, he would be glad of my company for a little\n",
      "walk in the garden; and down I went that very moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came to meet me. So, says he, how does my dear girl do now?--Whom do\n",
      "you think I have seen since I have been out?--I don't know, sir, said I.\n",
      "Why, said he, there is a turning in the road, about five miles off,\n",
      "that goes round a meadow, that has a pleasant foot-way, by the side of a\n",
      "little brook, and a double row of limes on each side, where now and\n",
      "then the gentry in the neighbourhood walk, and angle, and divert\n",
      "themselves.--I'll shew it you next opportunity.--And I stept out of my\n",
      "chariot, to walk across this meadow, and bid Robin meet me with it on\n",
      "the further part of it: And whom should I 'spy there, walking, with a\n",
      "book in his hand, reading, but your humble servant Mr. Williams! Don't\n",
      "blush, Pamela, said he. As his back was towards me, I thought I would\n",
      "speak to the man: and, before he saw me, I said, How do you, old\n",
      "acquaintance? (for, said he, you know we were of one college for a\n",
      "twelvemonth.) I thought the man would have jumped into the brook, he\n",
      "gave such a start at hearing my voice, and seeing me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor man! said I. Ay, said he, but not too much of your poor man, in\n",
      "that soft accent, neither, Pamela.--Said I, I am sorry my voice is so\n",
      "startling to you, Mr. Williams. What are you reading? Sir, said he, and\n",
      "stammered with the surprise, it is the French Telemachus; for I am about\n",
      "perfecting myself, if I can, in the French tongue.--Thought I, I had\n",
      "rather so, than perfecting my Pamela in it.--You do well, replied\n",
      "I.--Don't you think that yonder cloud may give us a small shower? and it\n",
      "did a little begin to wet.--He said, he believed not much.\n",
      "\n",
      "If, said I, you are for the village, I'll give you a cast; for I shall\n",
      "call at Sir Simon's in my return from the little round I am taking. He\n",
      "asked me if it was not too great a favour?--No, said I, don't talk of\n",
      "that; let us walk to the further opening there, and we shall meet my\n",
      "chariot.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Pamela, continued my master, we fell into conversation as we walked.\n",
      "He said he was very sorry he had incurred my displeasure; and the more,\n",
      "as he had been told, by Lady Jones, who had it from Sir Simon's family,\n",
      "that I had a more honourable view than at first was apprehended. I\n",
      "said, We fellows of fortune, Mr. Williams, take sometimes a little more\n",
      "liberty with the world than we ought to do; wantoning, very probably,\n",
      "as you contemplative folks would say, in the sunbeams of a dangerous\n",
      "affluence; and cannot think of confining ourselves to the common paths,\n",
      "though the safest and most eligible, after all. And you may believe I\n",
      "could not very well like to be supplanted in a view that lay next my\n",
      "heart; and that by an old acquaintance, whose good, before this affair,\n",
      "I was studious to promote.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would only say, sir, said he, that my first motive was entirely such\n",
      "as became my function: And, very politely, said my master, he added, And\n",
      "I am very sure, that however inexcusable I might seem in the progress\n",
      "of the matter, yourself, sir, would have been sorry to have it said, you\n",
      "had cast your thoughts on a person, that nobody could have wished for\n",
      "but yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Mr. Williams, said I, I see you are a man of gallantry, as well as\n",
      "religion: But what I took most amiss was, that, if you thought me doing\n",
      "a wrong thing, you did not expostulate with me upon it, as your function\n",
      "might have allowed you to do; but immediately determined to counterplot\n",
      "me, and attempt to secure to yourself a prize you would have robbed\n",
      "me of, and that from my own house. But the matter is at an end, and I\n",
      "retain not any malice upon it; though you did not know but I might, at\n",
      "last, do honourably by her, as I actually intend.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sorry for myself, sir, said he, that I should so unhappily\n",
      "incur your displeasure; but I rejoice for her sake in your honourable\n",
      "intentions: give me leave only to say, that if you make Miss Andrews\n",
      "your lady, she will do credit to your choice with every body that\n",
      "sees her, or comes to know her; and, for person and mind both, you may\n",
      "challenge the county.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this manner, said my master, did the parson and I confabulate; and\n",
      "I set him down at his lodgings in the village. But he kept your secret,\n",
      "Pamela; and would not own, that you gave any encouragement to his\n",
      "addresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, sir, said I, he could not say that I did; and I hope you believe\n",
      "me. I do, I do, said he: but 'tis still my opinion, that if, when I saw\n",
      "plots set up against my plots, I had not discovered the parson as I did,\n",
      "the correspondence between you might have gone to a length that would\n",
      "have put our present situation out of both our powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, when you consider, that my utmost presumption could not\n",
      "make me hope for the honour you now seem to design me; that I was so\n",
      "hardly used, and had no prospect before me but dishonour, you will allow\n",
      "that I should have seemed very little in earnest in my professions of\n",
      "honesty, if I had not endeavoured to get away: but yet I resolved not\n",
      "to think of marriage; for I never saw the man I could love, till your\n",
      "goodness emboldened me to look up to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should, my dear Pamela, said he, make a very ill compliment to my\n",
      "vanity, if I did not believe you; though, at the same time, justice\n",
      "calls upon me to say, that it is, some things considered, beyond my\n",
      "merit.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a sweet, noble expression for your poor daughter, my dear\n",
      "father and mother!--And from my master too!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was glad to hear this account of the interview between Mr. Williams\n",
      "and himself; but I dared not to say so. I hope in time he will be\n",
      "reinstated in his good graces.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was so good as to tell me, he had given orders for the chapel to\n",
      "be cleared. O how I look forward with inward joy, yet with fear and\n",
      "trembling!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "About twelve o'clock came Sir Simon, and his lady and two daughters; and\n",
      "Lady Jones, and a sister-in-law of hers; and Mr. Peters, and his\n",
      "spouse and niece. Mrs. Jewkes, who is more and more obliging, was much\n",
      "concerned I was not dressed in some of my best clothes, and made me many\n",
      "compliments.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all went into the garden for a walk, before dinner; and, I\n",
      "understood, were so impatient to see me, that my master took them into\n",
      "the largest alcove, after they had walked two or three turns, and stept\n",
      "himself to me. Come, my Pamela, said he, the ladies can't be satisfied\n",
      "without seeing you, and I desire you'll come. I said, I was ashamed; but\n",
      "I would obey him. Said he, The two young ladies are dressed out in their\n",
      "best attire; but they make not such an appearance as my charming girl\n",
      "in this ordinary garb.--Sir, said I, shan't I follow you thither? For\n",
      "I can't bear you should do me so much honour. Well, said he, I'll go\n",
      "before you. And he bid Mrs. Jewkes bring a bottle of sack, and some\n",
      "cake. So he went down to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "This alcove fronts the longest gravel-walk in the garden, so that\n",
      "they saw me all the way I came, for a good way: and my master told me\n",
      "afterwards, with pleasure, all they said of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will you forgive the little vain slut, your daughter, if I tell you all,\n",
      "as he was pleased to tell me? He said, 'spying me first, Look, there,\n",
      "ladies, comes my pretty rustic!--They all, I saw, which dashed me, stood\n",
      "at the windows, and in the door-way, looking full at me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master told me, that Lady Jones said, She is a charming creature, I\n",
      "see that, at this distance. And Sir Simon, it seems, who has been a sad\n",
      "rake in his younger days, swore he never saw so easy an air, so fine\n",
      "a shape, and so graceful a presence.--The Lady Darnford said, I was a\n",
      "sweet girl. And Mrs. Peters said very handsome things. Even the parson\n",
      "said, I should be the pride of the county. O, dear sirs! all this was\n",
      "owing to the light my good master's favour placed me in, which made\n",
      "me shine out in their eyes beyond my deserts. He said the young ladies\n",
      "blushed, and envied me.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I came near, he saw me in a little confusion, and was so kind as\n",
      "to meet me: Give me your hand, said he, my poor girl; you walk too fast,\n",
      "(for, indeed, I wanted to be out of their gazing). I did so, with a\n",
      "courtesy, and he led me up the steps of the alcove, and, in a most\n",
      "gentleman-like manner, presented me to the ladies, and they all saluted\n",
      "me, and said, They hoped to be better acquainted with me: and\n",
      "Lady Darnford was pleased to say, I should be the flower of their\n",
      "neighbourhood. Sir Simon said, Good neighbour, by your leave; and\n",
      "saluting me, added, Now will I say, that I have kissed the loveliest\n",
      "maiden in England. But, for all this, methought I owed him a grudge\n",
      "for a tell-tale, though all had turned out so happily. Mr. Peters very\n",
      "gravely followed his example, and said, like a bishop, God bless you,\n",
      "fair excellence! said Lady Jones, Pray, dear madam, sit down by me:\n",
      "and they all sat down: But I said, I would stand, if they pleased.\n",
      "No, Pamela, said my master: pray sit down with these good ladies, my\n",
      "neighbours:--They will indulge it to you, for my sake, till they know\n",
      "you better; and for your own, when they are acquainted with you. Sir,\n",
      "said I, I shall be proud to deserve their indulgence.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all so gazed at me, that I could not look up; for I think it is one\n",
      "of the distinctions of persons of condition, and well-bred people, to\n",
      "put bashful bodies out of countenance. Well, Sir Simon, said my master,\n",
      "what say you now to my pretty rustic?--He swore a great oath, that he\n",
      "should better know what to say to me if he was as young as himself. Lady\n",
      "Darnford said, You will never leave, Sir Simon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said my master, You are a little confused, my good girl, and out of\n",
      "breath; but I have told all my kind neighbours here a good deal of your\n",
      "story, and your excellence. Yes, said Lady Darnford, my dear neighbour,\n",
      "as I will call you; we that are here present have all heard of your\n",
      "uncommon story. Madam, said I, you have then heard what must make your\n",
      "kind allowance for me very necessary. No, said Mrs. Peters, we have\n",
      "heard what will always make you valued as an honour to our sex, and as\n",
      "a worthy pattern for all the young ladies in the county. You are very\n",
      "good, madam, said I, to make me able to look up, and to be thankful for\n",
      "the honour you are pleased to do me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes came in with the canary, brought by Nan, to the alcove, and\n",
      "some cakes on a silver salver; and I said, Mrs. Jewkes, let me be your\n",
      "assistant; I will serve the ladies with the cake. And so I took the\n",
      "salver, and went round to the good company with it, ending with my\n",
      "master. The Lady Jones said, She never was served with such a grace,\n",
      "and it was giving me too much trouble. O, madam, said I, I hope my good\n",
      "master's favour will never make me forget, that it is my duty to wait\n",
      "upon his friends. Master, sweet one! said Sir Simon, I hope you won't\n",
      "always call Mr. B---- by that name, for fear it should become a fashion\n",
      "for all our ladies to do the like through the county. I, sir, said I,\n",
      "shall have many reasons to continue this style, which cannot affect your\n",
      "good ladies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Simon, said Lady Jones, you are very arch upon us but I see very\n",
      "well, that it will be the interest of all the gentlemen, to bring their\n",
      "ladies into an intimacy with one that can give them such a good example.\n",
      "I am sure then, madam, said I, it must be after I have been polished and\n",
      "improved by the honour of such an example as yours.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all were very good and affable; and the young Lady Darnford, who\n",
      "had wished to see me in this dress, said, I beg your pardon, dear miss,\n",
      "as she called me; but I had heard how sweetly this garb became you, and\n",
      "was told the history of it; and I begged it, as a favour, that you\n",
      "might oblige us with your appearance in it. I am much obliged to your\n",
      "ladyship, said I, that your kind prescription was so agreeable to my\n",
      "choice. Why, said she, was it your choice then?--I am glad of that:\n",
      "though I am sure your person must give, and not take, ornament from any\n",
      "dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are very kind, madam, said I: but there will be the less reason to\n",
      "fear I should forget the high obligations I should have to the kindest\n",
      "of gentlemen, when I can delight to shew the humble degree from which\n",
      "his goodness had raised me.--My dear Pamela, said my master, if you\n",
      "proceed at this rate, I must insist upon your first seven days. You know\n",
      "what I mean. Sir, said I, you are all goodness!\n",
      "\n",
      "They drank a glass of sack each, and Sir Simon would make me do so too,\n",
      "saying, It will be a reflection, madam, upon all the ladies, if you\n",
      "don't do as they. No, Sir Simon, said I, that can't be, because the\n",
      "ladies' journey hither makes a glass of canary a proper cordial for\n",
      "them: but I won't refuse; because I will do myself the honour of\n",
      "drinking good health to you, and to all this worthy company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said good Lady Darnford, to my master, I hope, sir, we shall have Mrs.\n",
      "Andrews's company at table. He said, very obligingly, Madam, it is her\n",
      "time now; and I will leave it to her choice. If the good ladies, then,\n",
      "will forgive me, sir, said I, I had rather be excused. They all said,\n",
      "I must not be excused. I begged I might. Your reason for it, my dear\n",
      "Pamela? said my master: since the ladies request it, I wish you would\n",
      "oblige them. Sir, replied I, your goodness will make me, every day,\n",
      "worthier of the honour the ladies do me; and when I can persuade myself\n",
      "that I am more worthy of it than at present, I shall with great joy\n",
      "embrace all the opportunities they will be pleased to give me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Peters whispered Lady Jones, as my master told me afterwards; Did\n",
      "you ever see such excellence, such prudence, and discretion? Never in my\n",
      "life, said the other good lady. She will adorn, she was pleased to say,\n",
      "her distinction. Ay, says Mrs. Peters, she would adorn any station in\n",
      "life.\n",
      "\n",
      "My good master was highly delighted, generous gentleman as he is! with\n",
      "the favourable opinion of the ladies; and I took the more pleasure in\n",
      "it, because their favour seemed to lessen the disgrace of his stooping\n",
      "so much beneath himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Darnford said, We will not oppress you; though we could almost\n",
      "blame your too punctilious exactness: but if we excuse Miss Andrews from\n",
      "dinner, we must insist upon her company at the card-table, and at a dish\n",
      "of tea; for we intend to pass the whole day with you, sir, as we told\n",
      "you. What say you to that, Pamela, said my master. Sir, replied I,\n",
      "whatever you and the ladies please, I will cheerfully do. They said, I\n",
      "was very obliging. But Sir Simon rapt out an oath, and said, That they\n",
      "might dine together, if they would; but he would dine with me, and\n",
      "nobody else: for, said he, I say, sir, as Parson Williams said, (by\n",
      "which I found my master had told them the story,) You must not think you\n",
      "have chosen one that nobody can like but yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young ladies said, If I pleased they would take a turn about the\n",
      "garden with me. I answered, I would very gladly attend them; and so we\n",
      "three, and Lady Jones's sister-in-law, and Mr. Peters's niece, walked\n",
      "together. They were very affable, kind, and obliging; and we soon\n",
      "entered into a good deal of familiarity; and I found Miss Darnford a\n",
      "very agreeable person. Her sister was a little more on the reserve; and\n",
      "I afterwards heard, that, about a year before, she would fain have had\n",
      "my master make his addresses to her: but though Sir Simon is reckoned\n",
      "rich, she was not thought sufficient fortune for him. And now, to have\n",
      "him look down so low as me, must be a sort of mortification to a poor\n",
      "young lady!--And I pitied her.--Indeed I did!--I wish all young persons\n",
      "of my sex could be as happy as I am like to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master told me afterwards, that I left the other ladies, and Sir\n",
      "Simon and Mr. Peters, full of my praises: so that they could hardly talk\n",
      "of any thing else; one launching out upon my complexion, another upon my\n",
      "eyes, my hand, and, in short, for you'll think me sadly proud, upon\n",
      "my whole person and behaviour; and they all magnified my readiness and\n",
      "obligingness in my answers, and the like: And I was glad of it, as I\n",
      "said, for my good master's sake, who seemed quite pleased and rejoiced.\n",
      "God bless him for his goodness to me!\n",

      "shaved; and so, after he had eaten some bread and cheese, and drank\n",
      "a can of ale, he set out for my master's house, with a heavy heart,\n",
      "dreading for me, and in much fear of being brow-beaten. He had, it\n",

      "hopes to hear something of me: And they said, A housekeeper, two maids,\n",
      "and, at present, two coachmen, and two grooms, a footman, and a helper.\n",
      "Was that all? he said. They told him, there was a young creature there,\n",
      "belike who was, or was to be, his mistress, or somewhat of that nature;\n",
      "but had been his mother's waiting-maid. This, he said, grieved his\n",

      "At that she went into the great parlour, where my master was talking\n",

      "and is very earnest. Ay, said he, Who can that be?--Let him stay in the\n",
      "little hall, and I'll come to him presently. They all seemed to stare;\n",
      "and Sir Simon said, No more nor less, I dare say, my good friend, but\n",
      "a bastard-child. If it is, said Lady Jones, bring it in to us. I will,\n",

      "burst out into tears. (O what trouble have I given you both!) My master\n",
      "said, taking him by the hand, Don't be uneasy, Goodman Andrews; your\n",
      "daughter is in the way to be happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "This alarmed my dear father, and he said, What! then, is she dying? And\n",
      "trembled, he could scarce stand. My master made him sit down, and sat\n",
      "down by him, and said, No; God be praised! she is very well: And pray\n",
      "be comforted; I cannot bear to see you thus apprehensive; but she has\n",

      "satisfied, and happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, sir I said he, you told me once she was in London, waiting on a\n",

      "that's all over now, Goodman Andrews, said my master: but the times are\n",
      "altered; for now the sweet girl has taken me prisoner; and in a few days\n",
      "I shall put on the most agreeable fetters that ever man wore.\n",
      "\n",
      "O, sir! said, he, you are too pleasant for my griefs. My heart's almost\n",
      "broke. But may I not see my poor child? You shall presently, said he;\n",
      "for she is coming down to us; and since you won't believe me, I hope you\n",
      "will her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will ask you, good sir, said he, but one question till then, that\n",
      "I may know how to look upon her when I see her. Is she honest? Is she\n",
      "virtuous?--As the new-born babe, Mr. Andrews, said my good master; and\n",
      "in twelve days time, I hope, will be my wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "O flatter me not, good your honour, said he: It cannot be! it cannot\n",
      "be!--I fear you have deluded her with strange hopes; and would make\n",
      "me believe impossibilities!--Mrs. Jewkes, said he, do you tell my dear\n",
      "Pamela's good father, when I go out, all you know concerning me, and\n",
      "your mistress that is to be. Meantime, make much of him, and set out\n",
      "what you have; and make him drink a glass of what he likes best. If this\n",
      "be wine, added he, fill me a bumper.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did so; and he took my father by the hand, and said, Believe me,\n",
      "good man, and be easy; for I can't bear to see you tortured in this\n",
      "cruel suspense: Your dear daughter is the beloved of my soul. I am glad\n",
      "you are come: for you'll see us all in the same story. And here's your\n",
      "dame's health; and God bless you both, for being the happy means of\n",
      "procuring for me so great a blessing! And so he drank a bumper to this\n",
      "most obliging health.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do I hear? It cannot surely be! said my father. And your honour is\n",
      "too good, I hope, to mock a poor old man--This ugly story, sir, of the\n",
      "bishop, runs in my head--But you say I shall see my dear child--And I\n",
      "shall see her honest.--If not, poor as I am, I would not own her.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master bid Mrs. Jewkes not to let me know yet, that my father\n",
      "was come; and went to the company, and said, I have been agreeably\n",
      "surprised: Here is honest old Goodman Andrews come full of grief to see\n",
      "his daughter; for he fears she is seduced; and tells me, good honest\n",
      "man, that, poor as he is, he will not own her, if she be not virtuous.\n",
      "O, said they all, with one voice almost, Dear sir! shall we not see the\n",
      "good old man you have so praised for his plain good sense, and honest\n",
      "heart? If, said he, I thought Pamela would not be too much affected with\n",
      "the surprise, I would make you all witness to their first interview; for\n",
      "never did daughter love a father, or a father a daughter, as they two do\n",
      "one another. Miss Darnford, and all the ladies, and the gentlemen too,\n",
      "begged it might be so. But was not this very cruel, my dear mother? For\n",
      "well might they think I should not support myself in such an agreeable\n",
      "surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, kindly, I have but one fear, that the dear girl may be too much\n",
      "affected. O, said Lady Darnford, we'll all help to keep up her spirits.\n",
      "Says he, I'll go up, and prepare her; but won't tell her of it. So he\n",
      "came up to me, as I have said, and amused me about Mr. Williams, to half\n",
      "prepare me for some surprise; though that could not have been any thing\n",
      "to this: and he left me, as I said, in that suspense, at his mystical\n",
      "words, saying, He would send to me, when they were going to cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master went from me to my father, and asked if he had eaten any\n",
      "thing. No, said Mrs. Jewkes; the good man's heart is so full, he cannot\n",
      "eat, nor do any thing, till he has seen his dear daughter. That shall\n",
      "soon be, said my master. I will have you come in with me; for she is\n",
      "going to sit down with my guests, to a game at quadrille; and I will\n",
      "send for her down. O, sir, said my father, don't, don't let me; I am not\n",
      "fit to appear before your guests; let me see my daughter by myself,\n",
      "I beseech you. Said he, They all know your honest character, Goodman\n",
      "Andrews, and long to see you, for Pamela's sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he took my father by the hand, and led him in, against his will, to\n",
      "the company. They were all very good. My master kindly said, Ladies and\n",
      "gentlemen, I present to you one of the honestest men in England, my good\n",
      "Pamela's father. Mr. Peters went to him, and took him by the hand, and\n",
      "said, We are all glad to see you, sir; you are the happiest man in the\n",
      "world in a daughter; whom we never saw before to-day, but cannot enough\n",
      "admire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said my master, This gentleman, Goodman Andrews, is the minister of the\n",
      "parish; but is not young enough for Mr. Williams. This airy expression,\n",
      "my poor father said, made him fear, for a moment, that all was a\n",
      "jest.--Sir Simon also took him by the hand, and said, Ay, you have a\n",
      "sweet daughter, Honesty; we are all in love with her. And the ladies\n",
      "came, and said very fine things: Lady Darnford particularly, That he\n",
      "might think himself the happiest man in England, in such a daughter. If,\n",
      "and please you, madam, said he, she be but virtuous, 'tis all in all:\n",
      "For all the rest is accident. But I doubt his honour has been too much\n",
      "upon the jest with me. No, said Mrs. Peters, we are all witnesses, that\n",
      "he intends very honourably by her.--It is some comfort, said he, and\n",
      "wiped his eyes, that such good ladies say so--But I wish I could see\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "They would have had him sit down by them; but he would only sit behind\n",
      "the door, in the corner of the room, so that one could not soon see him\n",
      "as one came in; because the door opened against him, and hid him almost.\n",
      "The ladies all sat down; and my master said, Desire Mrs. Jewkes to step\n",
      "up, and tell Mrs. Andrews the ladies wait for her. So down I came.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Darnford rose, and met me at the door, and said, Well, Miss\n",
      "Andrews, we longed for your company. I did not see my dear father; and\n",
      "it seems his heart was too full to speak; and he got up, and sat down\n",
      "three or four times successively, unable to come to me, or to say any\n",
      "thing. The ladies looked that way: but I would not, supposing it was\n",
      "Mr. Williams. And they made me sit down between Lady Darnford and\n",
      "Lady Jones; and asked me, what we should play at? I said, At what your\n",
      "ladyships please. I wondered to see them smile, and look upon me, and to\n",
      "that corner of the room; but I was afraid of looking that way, for fear\n",
      "of seeing Mr. Williams; though my face was that way too, and the table\n",
      "before me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said my master, Did you send your letter away to the posthouse, my good\n",
      "girl, for your father? To be sure, sir, said I, I did not forget that:\n",
      "I took the liberty to desire Mr. Thomas to carry it. What, said he, I\n",
      "wonder, will the good old couple say to it? O sir, said I, your goodness\n",
      "will be a cordial to their dear honest hearts! At that, my dear father,\n",
      "not able to contain himself, nor yet to stir from the place, gushed out\n",
      "into a flood of tears, which he, good soul! had been struggling with, it\n",
      "seems; and cried out, O my dear child!\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew the voice, and, lifting up my eyes, and seeing my father, gave a\n",
      "spring, overturned the table, without regard to the company, and threw\n",
      "myself at his feet: O my father! my father! said I, can it be?--Is it\n",
      "you? Yes, it is! it is!--O bless your happy daughter! I would have said,\n",
      "and down I sunk.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master seemed concerned--I feared, said he, that the surprise would\n",
      "be too much for her spirits; and all the ladies ran to me, and made me\n",
      "drink a glass of water; and I found myself encircled in the arms of my\n",
      "dearest father.--O tell me, said I, every thing! How long have you been\n",
      "here? When did you come? How does my honoured mother? And half a dozen\n",
      "questions more, before he could answer one.\n",
      "\n",
      "They permitted me to retire with my father; and then I poured forth\n",
      "all my vows and thanksgivings to God for this additional blessing; and\n",
      "confirmed all my master's goodness to his scarce-believing amazement.\n",
      "And we kneeled together, blessing God, and one another, for several\n",
      "ecstatic minutes and my master coming in soon after, my dear father\n",
      "said, O sir, what a change is this! May, God reward and bless you, both\n",
      "in this world and the next!\n",
      "\n",
      "May God bless us all! said he. But how does my sweet girl? I have been\n",
      "in pain for you--I am sorry I did not apprise you beforehand.\n",
      "\n",
      "O sir, said I, it was you; and all you do must be good--But this was a\n",
      "blessing so unexpected!----\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said he, you have given pain to all the company. They will be glad\n",
      "to see you, when you can: for you have spoiled all their diversion; and\n",
      "yet painfully delighted them at the same time. Mr. Andrews, added he, do\n",
      "you make this house your own; and the longer you stay, the more welcome\n",
      "you'll be. After you have a little composed yourself, my dear girl, step\n",
      "in to us again. I am glad to see you so well already. And so he left us.\n",
      "\n",
      "See you, my dear father, said I, what goodness there is in this once\n",
      "naughty master! O pray for him! and pray for me, that I may deserve it!\n",
      "\n",
      "How long has this happy change been wrought, my dear child?--O, said I,\n",
      "several happy days!--I have written down every thing; and you'll see,\n",
      "from the depth of misery, what God has done for your happy daughter!\n",
      "\n",
      "Blessed be his name! said he. But do you say he will marry you? Can it\n",
      "be, that such a brave gentleman will make a lady of the child of such a\n",
      "poor man as I? O the divine goodness! How will your poor dear mother\n",
      "be able to support these happy tidings? I will set out to-morrow, to\n",
      "acquaint her with them: for I am but half happy, till the dear good\n",
      "woman shares them with me!--To be sure, my dear child, we ought to go\n",
      "into some far country to hide ourselves, that we may not disgrace you by\n",
      "our poverty!\n",
      "\n",
      "O, my dear father, said I, now you are unkind for the first time! Your\n",
      "poverty has been my glory, and my riches; and I have nothing to brag of,\n",
      "but that I ever thought it an honour, rather than a disgrace; because\n",
      "you were always so honest, that your child might well boast of such a\n",
      "parentage!\n",
      "\n",
      "In this manner, my dear mother, did we pass the happy moments, till Miss\n",
      "Darnford came to me, and said, How do you do, dear madam? I rejoice to\n",
      "see you so well! Pray let us have your company. And yours too, good Mr.\n",
      "Andrews, taking his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was very obliging, I told her; and we went to the great parlour;\n",
      "and my master took my father by the hand, and made him sit down by him,\n",
      "and drink a glass of wine with him. Mean-time, I made my excuses to\n",
      "the ladies, as well as I could, which they readily granted me. But Sir\n",
      "Simon, after his comical manner, put his hands on my shoulders: Let me\n",
      "see, let me see, said he, where your wings grow; for I never saw any\n",
      "body fly like you.--Why, said he, you have broken Lady Jones's shins\n",
      "with the table. Shew her else, madam.\n",
      "\n",
      "His pleasantry made them laugh. And I said, I was very sorry for my\n",
      "extravagancy: and if it had not been my master's doings, I should\n",
      "have said, it was a fault to permit me to be surprised, and put out of\n",
      "myself, before such good company. They said, All was very excusable; and\n",
      "they were glad I suffered no more by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were so kind as to excuse me at cards, and played by themselves;\n",
      "and I went by my master's commands and sat on the other side, in the\n",
      "happiest place I ever was blest with, between two of the dearest men in\n",
      "the world to me, and each holding one of my hands:--my father, every now\n",
      "and then, with tears, lifting up his eyes, and saying, Could I ever have\n",
      "hoped this!\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked him, If he had been so kind as to bring the papers with him? He\n",
      "said, He had; and looked at me, as who should say, Must I give them to\n",
      "you now?--I said, Be pleased to let me have them. He pulled them from\n",
      "his pocket; and I stood up, and, with my best duty, gave them into my\n",
      "master's hands. He said, Thank you, Pamela. Your father shall take all\n",
      "with him, so see what a sad fellow I have been, as well as the present\n",
      "happier alteration. But I must have them all again, for the writer's\n",
      "sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ladies and gentlemen would make me govern the tea-table, whatever I\n",
      "could do; and Abraham attended me, to serve the company. My master and\n",
      "my father sat together, and drank a glass or two of wine instead of tea,\n",
      "and Sir Simon joked with my master, saying, I warrant you would not be\n",
      "such a woman's man, as to drink tea, for ever so much, with the ladies.\n",
      "But your time's coming, and I doubt not you'll be made as comfortable as\n",
      "I.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master was very urgent with them to stay supper; and at last they\n",
      "complied, on condition that I would grace the table, as they were\n",
      "pleased to call it. I begged to be excused. My master said, Don't be\n",
      "excused, Pamela, since the ladies desire it: And besides, said he, we\n",
      "won't part with your father; and so you may as well stay with us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was in hopes my father and I might sup by ourselves, or only with Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes. And Miss Darnford, who is a most obliging young lady, said, We\n",
      "will not part with you, indeed we won't.\n",
      "\n",
      "When supper was brought in, Lady Darnford took me by the hand, and said\n",
      "to my master, Sir, by your leave; and would have placed me at the upper\n",
      "end of the table. Pray, pray, madam, said I, excuse me; I cannot do it,\n",
      "indeed I cannot. Pamela, said my master, to the great delight of my good\n",
      "father, as I could see by his looks, oblige Lady Darnford, since she\n",
      "desires it. It is but a little before your time, you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear, good sir, said I, pray don't command it! Let me sit by my father,\n",
      "pray! Why, said Sir Simon, here's ado indeed! Sit down at the upper end,\n",
      "as you should do; and your father shall sit by you, there. This put my\n",
      "dear father upon difficulties. And my master said, Come, I'll place you\n",
      "all: and so put Lady Darnford at the upper end, Lady Jones at her right\n",
      "hand, and Mrs. Peters on the other; and he placed me between the two\n",
      "young ladies; but very genteelly put Miss Darnford below her younger\n",
      "sister; saying, Come, miss, I put you here, because you shall hedge in\n",
      "this little cuckow; for I take notice, with pleasure, of your goodness\n",
      "to her; and, besides, all you very young ladies should sit together.\n",
      "This seemed to please both sisters; for had the youngest miss been put\n",
      "there, it might have piqued her, as matters have been formerly, to be\n",
      "placed below me; whereas Miss Darnford giving place to her youngest\n",
      "sister, made it less odd she should to me; especially with that handsome\n",
      "turn of the dear man, as if I was a cuckow, and to be hedged in.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master kindly said, Come, Mr. Andrews, you and I will sit together.\n",
      "And so took his place at the bottom of the table, and set my father\n",
      "on his right hand; and Sir Simon would sit on his left. For, said he,\n",
      "parson, I think the petticoats should sit together; and so do you sit\n",
      "down by that lady (his sister). A boiled turkey standing by me, my\n",
      "master said, Cut up that turkey, Pamela, if it be not too strong work\n",
      "for you, that Lady Darnford may not have too much trouble. So I carved\n",
      "it in a trice, and helped the ladies. Miss Darnford said, I would give\n",
      "something to be so dexterous a carver. O madam, said I, my late good\n",
      "lady would always make me do these things, when she entertained her\n",
      "female friends, as she used to do on particular days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ay, said my master, I remember my poor mother would often say, if I, or\n",
      "any body at table, happened to be a little out in carving, I'll send up\n",
      "for my Pamela, to shew you how to carve. Said Lady Jones, Mrs. Andrews\n",
      "has every accomplishment of her sex. She is quite wonderful for her\n",
      "years. Miss Darnford said, And I can tell you, madam, that she plays\n",
      "sweetly upon the spinnet, and sings as sweetly to it; for she has a fine\n",
      "voice. Foolish! said Sir Simon; who, that hears her speak, knows not\n",
      "that? And who that sees her fingers, believes not that they were made to\n",
      "touch any key? O, parson! said he, 'tis well you're by, or I should have\n",
      "had a blush from the ladies. I hope not, Sir Simon, said Lady Jones; for\n",
      "a gentleman of your politeness would not say any thing that would make\n",
      "ladies blush.--No, no, said he, for the world: but if I had, it would\n",
      "have been, as the poet says,\n",
      "\n",
      "    'They blush, because they understand.'\n",
      "\n",
      "When the company went away, Lady Darnford, Lady Jones, and Mrs. Peters,\n",
      "severally invited my master, and me with him, to their houses; and\n",
      "begged he would permit me, at least, to come before we left those parts.\n",
      "And they said, We hope, when the happy knot is tied, you will induce Mr.\n",
      "B---- to reside more among us. We were always glad, said Lady Darnford,\n",
      "when he was here; but now shall have double reason. O what grateful\n",
      "things were these to the ears of my good father!\n",
      "\n",
      "When the company was gone, my master asked my father, if he smoked? He\n",
      "answered, No. He made us both sit down by him, and said, I have been\n",
      "telling this sweet girl, that in fourteen days, and two of them are\n",
      "gone, she must fix on one to make me happy. And have left it to her\n",
      "to choose either one of the first or last seven. My father held up his\n",
      "hands, and eyes; God bless your honour! said he, is all I can say. Now,\n",
      "Pamela, said my master, taking my hand, don't let a little wrong-timed\n",
      "bashfulness take place, without any other reason, because I should be\n",
      "glad to go to Bedfordshire as soon as I could; and I would not return\n",
      "till I carry my servants there a mistress, who should assist me to\n",
      "repair the mischiefs she has made in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not look up for confusion. And my father said, My dear child, I\n",
      "need not, I am sure, prompt your obedience in whatever will most oblige\n",
      "so good a gentleman. What says my Pamela? said my master: She does not\n",
      "use to be at a loss for expressions. Sir, said I, were I too sudden, it\n",
      "would look as if I doubted whether you would hold in your mind, and was\n",
      "not willing to give you time for reflection: but otherwise, to be sure I\n",
      "ought to resign myself implicitly to your will. Said he, I want not time\n",
      "for reflection: for I have often told you, and that long ago, I could\n",
      "not live without you: and my pride of condition made me both tempt\n",
      "and terrify you to other terms; but your virtue was proof against all\n",
      "temptations, and was not to be awed by terrors: Wherefore, as I could\n",
      "not conquer my passion for you, I corrected myself, and resolved, since\n",
      "you would not be mine upon my terms, you should upon your own: and now I\n",
      "desire you not on any other, I assure you: and I think the sooner it is\n",
      "done, the better. What say you, Mr. Andrews? Sir, said he, there is so\n",
      "much goodness on your side, and, blessed be God! so much prudence on my\n",
      "daughter's, that I must be quite silent. But when it is done, I and my\n",
      "poor wife shall have nothing to do, but to pray for you both, and to\n",
      "look back, with wonder and joy, on the ways of Providence.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, said my master, is Friday night; and suppose, my girl, it be next\n",
      "Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday morning?--Say, my Pamela.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will you, sir, said I, excuse me till to-morrow for an answer? I will,\n",
      "said he; and touched the bell, and called for Mrs. Jewkes. Where, said\n",
      "he, does Mr. Andrews lie tonight? You'll take care of him. He's a very\n",
      "good man; and will bring a blessing upon every house he sets his foot\n",
      "in.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear father wept for joy; and I could not refrain keeping him\n",
      "company. And my master, saluting me, bid us good night, and retired. And\n",
      "I waited upon my dear father, and was so full of prattle, of my master's\n",
      "goodness, and my future prospects, that I believed afterwards I was\n",
      "turned all into tongue: but he indulged me, and was transported with\n",
      "joy; and went to bed, and dreamed of nothing but Jacob's ladder, and\n",
      "angels ascending and descending, to bless him and his daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Saturday.\n",
      "\n",
      "I arose early in the morning; but found my father was up before me, and\n",
      "was gone to walk in the garden. I went to him: and with what delight,\n",
      "with what thankfulness, did we go over every scene of it, that had\n",
      "before been so dreadful to me! The fish-pond, the back-door, and every\n",
      "place. O what reason had we for thankfulness and gratitude!\n",
      "\n",
      "About seven o'clock my good master joined us, in his morning gown and\n",
      "slippers; and looking a little heavy, I said, Sir, I fear you had not\n",
      "good rest last night. That is your fault, Pamela, said he. After I went\n",
      "from you, I must needs look into your papers, and could not leave them\n",
      "till I had read them through; and so 'twas three o'clock before I went\n",
      "to sleep. I wish, sir, said I, you had had better entertainment. The\n",
      "worst part of it, said he, was what I had brought upon myself; and\n",
      "you have not spared me. Sir, said I--He interrupting me, said, Well, I\n",
      "forgive you. You had too much reason for it. But I find, plainly enough,\n",
      "that if you had got away, you would soon have been Williams's wife: and\n",
      "I can't see how it could well have been otherwise. Indeed, sir, said I,\n",
      "I had no notion of it, or of being any body's. I believe so, said he;\n",
      "but it must have come as a thing of course; and I see your father was\n",
      "for it. Sir, said he, I little thought of the honour your goodness would\n",
      "confer upon her; and I thought that would be a match above what we\n",
      "could do for her, a great deal. But when I found she was not for it, I\n",
      "resolved not to urge her; but leave all to her own prudence.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see, said he, all was sincere, honest, and open; and I speak of it, if\n",
      "it had been done, as a thing that could hardly well be avoided; and I\n",
      "am quite satisfied. But, said he, I must observe, as I have a hundred\n",
      "times, with admiration, what a prodigious memory, and easy and happy\n",
      "manner of narration, this excellent girl has! And though she is full\n",
      "of her pretty tricks and artifices, to escape the snares I had laid\n",
      "for her, yet all is innocent, lovely, and uniformly beautiful. You are\n",
      "exceedingly happy in a daughter; and I hope I shall be so in a wife--Or,\n",
      "said my father, may she not have that honour! I fear it not, said he;\n",
      "and I hope I shall deserve it of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, Pamela, said my master, I am sorry to find in some parts of your\n",
      "journal, that Mrs. Jewkes carried her orders a little too far: and I\n",
      "the more take notice of it, because you have not complained to me of\n",
      "her behaviour, as she might have expected for some parts of it; though a\n",
      "good deal was occasioned by my strict orders.--But she had the insolence\n",
      "to strike my girl, I find. Sir, said I, I was a little provoking, I\n",
      "believe; but as we forgave one another, I was the less entitled to\n",
      "complain of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said he, you are very good; but if you have any particular\n",
      "resentment, I will indulge it so far, as that she shall hereafter have\n",
      "nothing to do where you are. Sir, said I, you are so kind, that I ought\n",
      "to forgive every body; and when I see that my happiness is brought about\n",
      "by the very means that I thought then my greatest grievance, I ought to\n",
      "bless those means, and forgive all that was disagreeable to me at the\n",
      "same time, for the great good that hath issued from it.--That, said he,\n",
      "and kissed me, is sweetly considered! and it shall be my part to make\n",
      "you amends for what you have suffered, that you may still think lighter\n",
      "of the one, and have cause to rejoice in the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear father's heart was full; and he said, with his hands folded, and\n",
      "lifted up, Pray, sir, let me go--let me go--to my dear wife, and tell\n",
      "her all these blessed things, while my heart holds; for it is ready to\n",
      "burst with joy! Good man! said my master--I hope to hear this honest\n",
      "heart of yours speaking at your lips. I enjoin you, Pamela, to continue\n",
      "your relation, as you have opportunity; and though your father be here,\n",
      "write to your mother, that this wondrous story be perfect, and we, your\n",
      "friends, may read and admire you more and more. Ay, pray, pray do, my\n",
      "child, said my father; and this is the reason that I write on, my dear\n",
      "mother, when I thought not to do it, because my father could tell you\n",
      "all that passed while he was here.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master took notice of my psalm, and was pleased to commend it; and\n",
      "said, That I had very charitably turned the last verses, which, in the\n",
      "original, were full of heavy curses, to a wish that shewed I was not of\n",
      "an implacable disposition though my then usage might have excused it, if\n",
      "I had. But, said he, I think you shall sing it to me to-morrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "After we have breakfasted, added he, if you have no objection, Pamela,\n",
      "we'll take an airing together; and it shall be in the coach, because\n",
      "we'll have your father's company. He would have excused himself; but\n",
      "my master would have it so: but he was much ashamed, because of the\n",
      "meanness of his appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master would make us both breakfast with him on chocolate; and he\n",
      "said, I would have you, Pamela, begin to dress as you used to do; for\n",
      "now, at least, you may call your two other bundles your own; and if you\n",
      "want any thing against the approaching occasion, private as I design\n",
      "it, I'll send to Lincoln for it, by a special messenger. I said, My good\n",
      "lady's bounty, and his own, had set me much above my degree, and I had\n",
      "very good things of all sorts; and I did not desire any other, because\n",
      "I would not excite the censure of the ladies. That would be a different\n",
      "thing, he was pleased to say, when he publicly owned his nuptials, after\n",
      "we came to the other house. But, at present, if I was satisfied, he\n",
      "would not make words with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope, Mr. Andrews, said he, to my father, you'll not leave us till\n",
      "you see the affair over, and then you'll be sure I mean honourably: and,\n",
      "besides, Pamela will be induced to set the day sooner. O, sir, said he,\n",
      "I bless God I have no reason to doubt your meaning honourably: and I\n",
      "hope you'll excuse me, if I set out on Monday morning, very early, to my\n",
      "dear wife, and make her as happy as I am.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, Pamela, says my good master, may it not be performed on Tuesday?\n",
      "And then your father, maybe, will stay.--I should have been glad to\n",
      "have had it to-morrow, added he; but I have sent Monsieur Colbrand for\n",
      "a license, that, you may have no scruple unanswered; and he can't very\n",
      "well be back before to-morrow night, or Monday morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was most agreeable news. I said, Sir, I know my dear father will\n",
      "want to be at home: and as you was so good to give me a fortnight from\n",
      "last Thursday, I should be glad you would be pleased to indulge me still\n",
      "to some day in the second seven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said he, I will not be too urgent; but the sooner you fix,\n",
      "the better. Mr. Andrews, we must leave something to these Jephthah's\n",
      "daughters, in these cases, he was pleased to say: I suppose the little\n",
      "bashful folly, which, in the happiest circumstances, may give a kind of\n",
      "regret to quit the maiden state, and an awkwardness at the entrance into\n",
      "a new one, is a reason with Pamela; and so she shall name her day. Sir,\n",
      "said he, you are all goodness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went up soon after, and new dressed myself, taking possession, in a\n",
      "happy moment, I hope, of my two bundles, as my good master was pleased\n",
      "to call them; (alluding to my former division of those good things\n",
      "my lady and himself bestowed upon me;) and so put on fine linen, silk\n",
      "shoes, and fine white cotton stockings, a fine quilted coat, a delicate\n",
      "green Mantea silk gown and coat, a French necklace, and a laced cambric\n",
      "handkerchief, and clean gloves; and, taking my fan in my hand, I, like\n",
      "a little proud hussy, looked in the glass, and thought myself a\n",
      "gentlewoman once more; but I forgot not to return due thanks, for being\n",
      "able to put on this dress with so much comfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes would help to dress me, and complimented me highly, saying,\n",
      "among other things, That now I looked like a lady indeed: and as, she\n",
      "said, the little chapel was ready, and divine service would be read in\n",
      "it to-morrow, she wished the happy knot might then be tied. Said she,\n",
      "Have you not seen the chapel, madam, since it has been cleaned out? No,\n",
      "said I; but are we to have service in it to-morrow, do you say?--I am\n",
      "glad of that; for I have been a sad heathen lately, sore against my\n",
      "will!--But who is to officiate?--Somebody, replied she, Mr. Peters will\n",
      "send. You tell me very good news, said I, Mrs. Jewkes: I hope it will\n",
      "never be a lumber-room again.--Ay, said she, I can tell you more good\n",
      "news; for the two Misses Darnford, and Lady Jones, are to be here at the\n",
      "opening of it; and will stay and dine with you. My master, said I, has\n",
      "not told me that. You must alter your style, madam, said she: It must\n",
      "not be master now, sure!--O, returned I, this is a language I shall\n",
      "never forget: he shall always be my master; and I shall think myself\n",
      "more and more his servant.\n",
      "\n",
      "My poor father did not know I went up to dress myself; and he said his\n",
      "heart misgave him when he saw me first, for fear I was made a fool of,\n",
      "and that here was some fine lady that was to be my master's true wife.\n",
      "And he stood in admiration, and said, O, my dear child, how well will\n",
      "you become your happy condition! Why you look like a lady already! I\n",
      "hope, my dear father, said I, and boldly kissed him, I shall always be\n",
      "your dutiful daughter, whatever my condition be.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master sent me word he was ready; and when he saw me, said, Dress as\n",
      "you will, Pamela, you're a charming girl! and so handed me to the\n",
      "coach, and would make my father and me sit both on the foreside, and sat\n",
      "backwards, over against me; and bid the coachman drive to the meadow;\n",
      "that is, where he once met Mr. Williams.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation was most agreeable to me, and to my dear father, as\n",
      "we went; and he more and more exceeded in goodness and generosity; and,\n",
      "while I was gone up to dress, he had presented my father with twenty\n",
      "guineas; desiring him to buy himself and my mother such apparel as they\n",
      "should think proper; and lay it all out: but I knew not this till after\n",
      "we came home; my father having had no opportunity to tell me of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was pleased to inform me of the chapel being got in tolerable order;\n",
      "and said, it looked very well; and against he came down next, it should\n",
      "be all new white-washed, and painted and lined; and a new pulpit-cloth,\n",
      "cushion, desk, etc. and that it should always be kept in order for the\n",
      "future. He told me the two Misses Darnford, and Lady Jones, would dine\n",
      "with him on Sunday: And, with their servants and mine, said he, we shall\n",
      "make a tolerable congregation. And, added he, have I not well contrived\n",
      "to shew you that the chapel is really a little house of God, and has\n",
      "been consecrated, before we solemnize our nuptials in it?--O, sir,\n",
      "replied I, your goodness to me is inexpressible! Mr. Peters, said he,\n",
      "offered to come and officiate in it; but would not stay to dine with\n",
      "me, because he has company at his own house: and so I intend that divine\n",
      "service shall be performed in it by one to whom I shall make some yearly\n",
      "allowance, as a sort of chaplain.--You look serious, Pamela, added he:\n",
      "I know you think of your friend Williams. Indeed, sir, said I, if you\n",
      "won't be angry, I did. Poor man! I am sorry I have been the cause of his\n",
      "disobliging you.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we came to the meadow, where the gentry have their walk sometimes,\n",
      "the coach stopt, and my master alighted, and led me to the brook-side,\n",
      "and it is a very pretty summer walk. He asked my father, If he chose to\n",
      "walk out, or go on in the coach to the farther end? He, poor man, chose\n",
      "to go on in the coach, for fear, he said, any gentry should be walking\n",
      "there; and he told me, he was most of the way upon his knees in the\n",
      "coach, thanking God for his gracious mercies and goodness; and begging a\n",
      "blessing upon my good master and me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was quite astonished, when we came into the shady walk, to see Mr.\n",
      "Williams there. See there, said my master, there's poor Williams,\n",
      "taking his solitary walk again, with his book. And, it seems, it was so\n",
      "contrived; for Mr. Peters had been, as I since find, desired to tell him\n",
      "to be in that walk at such an hour in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, old acquaintance, said my master, again have I met you in this\n",
      "place? What book are you now reading? He said, it was Boileau's Lutrin.\n",
      "Said my master, You see I have brought with me my little fugitive,\n",
      "that would have been: While you are perfecting yourself in French, I am\n",
      "trying to learn English; and hope soon to be master of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mine, sir, said he, is a very beautiful piece of French: but your\n",
      "English has no equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are very polite, Mr. Williams, said my master: And he that does not\n",
      "think as you do, deserves no share in her. Why, Pamela, added he, very\n",
      "generously, why so strange, where you have once been so familiar? I\n",
      "do assure you both, that I mean not, by this interview, to insult Mr.\n",
      "Williams, or confound you. Then I said, Mr. Williams, I am very glad\n",
      "to see you well; and though the generous favour of my good master has\n",
      "happily changed the scene, since you and I last saw one another, I am\n",
      "nevertheless very glad of an opportunity to acknowledge, with gratitude,\n",
      "your good intentions, not so much to serve me, as me, but as a\n",
      "person--that then had great reason to believe herself in distress. And\n",
      "I hope, sir, added I, to my master, your goodness will permit me to say\n",
      "this.\n",
      "\n",
      "You, Pamela, said he, may make what acknowledgments you please to Mr.\n",
      "Williams's good intentions; and I would have you speak as you think;\n",
      "but I do not apprehend myself to be quite so much obliged to those\n",
      "intentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said Mr. Williams, I beg leave to say, I knew well, that, by\n",
      "education, you was no libertine; nor had I reason to think you so by\n",
      "inclination; and, when you came to reflect, I hoped you would not be\n",
      "displeased with me. And this was no small motive to me, at first, to do\n",
      "as I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ay, but Mr. Williams, said my master, could you think I should have had\n",
      "reason to thank you, if, loving one person above all her sex, you had\n",
      "robbed me of her, and married her yourself?--And then, said he, you are\n",
      "to consider, that she was an old acquaintance of mine, and a quite\n",
      "new one to you; that I had sent her down to my own house, for better\n",
      "securing her; and that you, who had access to my house, could not effect\n",
      "your purpose, without being guilty, in some sort, of a breach of the\n",
      "laws of hospitality and friendship. As to my designs upon her, I own\n",
      "they had not the best appearance; but still I was not answerable to Mr.\n",
      "Williams for those; much less could you be excused to invade a property\n",
      "so very dear to me, and to endeavour to gain an interest in her\n",
      "affections, when you could not be certain that matters would not turn\n",
      "out as they have actually done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I own, said he, that some parts of my conduct seem exceptionable, as\n",
      "you state it. But, sir, I am but a young man. I meant no harm. I had no\n",
      "interest, I am sure, to incur your displeasure; and when you think of\n",
      "every thing, and the inimitable graces of person, and perfections of\n",
      "mind, that adorn this excellent lady, (so he called me,) you will,\n",
      "perhaps, find your generosity allow something as an extenuation of a\n",
      "fault, which your anger would not permit as an excuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have done, said my master; nor did I meet you here to be angry with\n",
      "you. Pamela knew not that she should see you: and now you are both\n",
      "present, I would ask you, Mr. Williams, If, now you know my honourable\n",
      "designs towards this good girl, you can really be almost, I will not say\n",
      "quite, as well pleased with the friendship of my wife, as you could be\n",
      "with the favour of Mrs. Andrews?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said he, I will answer you truly. I think I could have preferred,\n",
      "with her, any condition that could have befallen me, had I considered\n",
      "only myself. But, sir, I was very far from having any encouragement to\n",
      "expect her favour; and I had much more reason to believe, that, if she\n",
      "could have hoped for your goodness, her heart would have been too much\n",
      "pre-engaged to think of any body else. And give me leave further to\n",
      "say, sir, that, though I tell you sincerely my thoughts, were I only to\n",
      "consider myself; yet, when I consider her good, and her merit, I should\n",
      "be highly ungenerous, were it put to my choice, if I could not wish her\n",
      "in a condition so much superior to what I could raise her to, and so\n",
      "very answerable to her merit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pamela, said my master, you are obliged to Mr. Williams, and ought to\n",
      "thank him: He has distinguished well. But, as for me, who had like to\n",
      "have lost you by his means, I am glad the matter was not left to his\n",
      "choice. Mr. Williams, added he, I give you Pamela's hand, because I know\n",
      "it will be pleasing to her, in token of her friendship and esteem for\n",
      "you; and I give you mine, that I will not be your enemy: but yet I must\n",
      "say, that I think I owe this proper manner of your thinking more to your\n",
      "disappointment, than to the generosity you talk of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Williams kissed my hand, as my master gave it him; and my master\n",
      "said, Sir, you will go home and dine with me, and I'll shew you my\n",
      "little chapel; and do you, Pamela, look upon yourself at liberty to\n",
      "number Mr. Williams in the list of your friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "How generous, how noble, was this! Mr. Williams (and so had I) had tears\n",
      "of pleasure in his eyes. I was silent: But Mr. Williams said, Sir, I\n",
      "shall be taught, by your generosity, to think myself inexcusably wrong,\n",
      "in every step I took, that could give you offence; and my future life\n",
      "shall shew my respectful gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "We walked on till we came to the coach, where was my dear father.\n",
      "Pamela, said my master, tell Mr. Williams who that good man is. O, Mr.\n",
      "Williams! said I, it is my dear father! and my master was pleased to\n",
      "say, One of the honestest men in England: Pamela owes every thing that\n",
      "she is to be, as well as her being, to him; for, I think, she would not\n",
      "have brought me to this, nor made so great resistance, but for the good\n",
      "lessons, and religious education, she had imbibed from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Williams said, taking father's hand, You see, good Mr. Andrews, with\n",
      "inexpressible pleasure, no doubt, the fruits of your pious care; and now\n",
      "are in a way, with your beloved daughter, to reap the happy effects of\n",
      "it.--I am overcome, said my dear father, with his honour's goodness: But\n",
      "I can only say, I bless God, and bless him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Williams and I being nearer the coach than my master, and he\n",
      "offering to draw back, to give way to him, he kindly said, Pray, Mr.\n",
      "Williams, oblige Pamela with your hand; and step in yourself. He bowed,\n",
      "and took my hand; and my master made him step in, and sit next me, all\n",
      "that ever he could do; and sat himself over against him, next my father,\n",
      "who sat against me.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he said, Mr. Andrews, I told you yesterday that the divine you saw\n",
      "was not Mr. Williams; I now tell you, this gentleman is: and though I\n",
      "have been telling him, I think not myself obliged to his intentions; yet\n",
      "I will own that Pamela and you are; and though I won't promise to love\n",
      "him, I would have you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said Mr. Williams, you have a way of overcoming, that hardly all\n",
      "my reading affords an instance of; and it is the more noble, as it is\n",
      "on this side, as I presume, the happy ceremony, which, great as your\n",
      "fortune is, will lay you under an obligation to so much virtue and\n",
      "beauty, when the lady becomes yours; for you will then have a treasure\n",
      "that princes might envy you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said my generous master, (God bless him!) Mr. Williams, it is impossible\n",
      "that you and I should long live at variance, when our sentiments agree\n",
      "so well together, on subjects the most material.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was quite confounded; and my master, seeing it, took my hand, and\n",
      "said, Look up, my good girl; and collect yourself.--Don't injure Mr.\n",
      "Williams and me so much, as to think we are capping compliments, as we\n",
      "used to do verses at school. I dare answer for us both, that we say not\n",
      "a syllable we don't think.\n",
      "\n",
      "O sir, said I, how unequal am I to all this goodness! Every moment that\n",
      "passes adds to the weight of the obligations you oppress me with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think not too much of that, said he most generously. Mr. Williams's\n",
      "compliments to you have great advantage of mine: For, though equally\n",
      "sincere, I have a great deal to say, and to do, to compensate the\n",
      "sufferings I have made you undergo; and, at last, must sit down\n",
      "dissatisfied, because those will never be balanced by all I can do for\n",
      "you.\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw my dear father quite unable to support these affecting instances\n",
      "of his goodness;--and he let go my hand, and took his; and said, seeing\n",
      "his tears, I wonder not, my dear Pamela's father, that your honest heart\n",
      "springs thus to your eyes, to see all her trials at an end. I will not\n",
      "pretend to say, that I had formerly either power or will to act thus:\n",
      "But since I began to resolve on the change you see, I have reaped so\n",
      "much pleasure in it, that my own interest will keep me steady: For, till\n",
      "within these few days, I knew not what it was to be happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Mr. Williams, with tears of joy in his eyes, said, How happily,\n",
      "sir, have you been touched by the divine grace, before you have been\n",
      "hurried into the commission of sins, that the deepest penitence could\n",
      "hardly have atoned for!--God has enabled you to stop short of the evil;\n",
      "and you have nothing to do, but to rejoice in the good, which now\n",
      "will be doubly so, because you can receive it without the least inward\n",
      "reproach.\n",
      "\n",
      "You do well, said he, to remind me, that I owe all this to the grace\n",
      "of God. I bless Him for it; and I thank this good man for his excellent\n",
      "lessons to his daughter; I thank her for following them: and I hope,\n",
      "from her good example, and your friendship, Mr. Williams, in time, to\n",
      "be half as good as my tutoress: and that, said he, I believe you'll own,\n",
      "will make me, without disparagement to any man, the best fox-hunter in\n",
      "England.--Mr. Williams was going to speak: and he said, You put on so\n",
      "grave a look, Mr. Williams, that, I believe, what I have said, with you\n",
      "practical good folks, is liable to exception: but I see we are become\n",
      "quite grave; and we must not be too serious neither.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a happy creature, my dear mother, is your Pamela!--O may my\n",
      "thankful heart, and the good use I may be enabled to make of the\n",
      "blessings before me, be a means to continue this delightful prospect to\n",
      "a long date, for the sake of the dear good gentleman, who thus becomes\n",
      "the happy instrument, in the hand of Providence, to bless all he smiles\n",
      "upon! To be sure, I shall never enough acknowledge the value he is\n",
      "pleased to express for my unworthiness, in that he has prevented my\n",
      "wishes, and, unasked, sought the occasion of being reconciled to a good\n",
      "man, who, for my sake, had incurred his displeasure; and whose name he\n",
      "could not, a few days before, permit to pass through my lips! But see\n",
      "the wonderful ways of Providence! The very things that I most dreaded\n",
      "his seeing or knowing, the contents of my papers, have, as I hope,\n",
      "satisfied all his scruples, and been a means to promote my happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Henceforth let not us poor short-sighted mortals pretend to rely on\n",
      "our own wisdom; or vainly think, that we are absolutely to direct for\n",
      "ourselves. I have abundant reason, I am sure, to say, that, when I was\n",
      "most disappointed, I was nearer my happiness: for had I made my escape,\n",
      "which was so often my chief point in view, and what I had placed my\n",
      "heart upon, I had escaped the blessings now before me, and fallen,\n",
      "perhaps headlong, into the miseries I would have avoided. And yet, after\n",
      "all, it was necessary I should take the steps I did, to bring on this\n",
      "wonderful turn: O the unsearchable wisdom of God!--And how much ought\n",
      "I to adore the divine goodness, and humble myself, who am made a poor\n",
      "instrument, as I hope, not only to magnify his graciousness to this fine\n",
      "gentleman and myself, but also to dispense benefits to others! Which God\n",
      "of his mercy grant!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the agreeable manner I have mentioned, did we pass the time in our\n",
      "second happy tour; and I thought Mrs. Jewkes would have sunk into the\n",
      "ground, when she saw Mr. Williams brought in the coach with us, and\n",
      "treated so kindly. We dined together in a most pleasant, easy, and frank\n",
      "manner; and I found I need not, from my master's generosity, to be under\n",
      "any restraint, as to my conduct to this good clergyman: For he, so often\n",
      "as he fancied I was reserved, moved me to be free with him, and to him;\n",
      "and several times called upon me to help my father and Mr. Williams; and\n",
      "seemed to take great delight in seeing me carve, as, indeed, he does in\n",
      "every thing I do.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner we went and looked into the chapel, which is a very pretty\n",
      "one, and very decent; and, when finished as he designs it, against his\n",
      "next coming down, will be a very pretty place.\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart, my dear mother, when I first set my foot in it, throbbed a\n",
      "good deal, with awful joy, at the thoughts of the solemnity, which, I\n",
      "hope, will in a few days be performed here. And when I came up\n",
      "towards the little pretty altar-piece, while they were looking at a\n",
      "communion-picture, and saying it was prettily done, I gently stept into\n",
      "a corner, out of sight, and poured out my soul to God on my knees, in\n",
      "supplication and thankfulness, that, after having been so long absent\n",
      "from divine service, the first time I entered into a house dedicated to\n",
      "his honour, should be with such blessed prospects before me; and\n",
      "begging of God to continue me humble, and to make me not unworthy of\n",
      "his mercies; and that he would be pleased to bless the next author of my\n",
      "happiness, my good master.\n",
      "\n",
      "I heard my master say, Where's Pamela? And so I broke off sooner than I\n",
      "would, and went up to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, Mr. Williams, I hope I have not so offended you by my conduct\n",
      "past, (for really it is what I ought to be ashamed of,) as that you will\n",
      "refuse to officiate, and to give us your instructions here to-morrow.\n",
      "Mr. Peters was so kind, for the first time, to offer it; but I knew it\n",
      "would be inconvenient for him; and, besides, I was willing to make this\n",
      "request to you an introduction to our reconciliation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said he, most willingly, and most gratefully, will I obey you:\n",
      "Though, if you expect a discourse, I am wholly unprepared for the\n",
      "occasion. I would not have it, replied he, pointed to any particular\n",
      "occasion; but if you have one upon the text--There is more joy in Heaven\n",
      "over one sinner that repenteth, than over ninety-nine just persons that\n",
      "need no repentance; and if it makes me not such a sad fellow as to be\n",
      "pointed at by mine and the ladies' servants we shall have here, I shall\n",
      "be well content. 'Tis a general subject, added he, makes me speak of\n",
      "that; but any one you please will do; for you cannot make a bad choice,\n",
      "I am sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said he, I have one upon that text; but I am ready to think, that\n",
      "a thanksgiving one, which I made on a great mercy to myself, if I may be\n",
      "permitted to make my own acknowledgments of your favour the subject of\n",
      "a discourse, will be suitable to my grateful sentiments. It is on the\n",
      "text;--Now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace; for mine eyes have\n",
      "seen thy salvation.\n",
      "\n",
      "That text, said I, will be a very suitable one for me. Not so, Pamela,\n",
      "said my master; because I don't let you depart in peace; but I hope you\n",
      "will stay here with content.\n",
      "\n",
      "O but, sir, said I, I have seen God's salvation!--I am sure, added I,\n",
      "if any body ever had reason, I have to say, with the blessed virgin, My\n",
      "soul doth magnify the Lord; for he hath regarded the low estate of his\n",
      "handmaiden--and exalted one of low degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said my good father, I am sure, if there were time for it, the book of\n",
      "Ruth would afford a fine subject for the honour done my dear child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, good Mr. Andrews, said my master, should you say so?--I know that\n",
      "story, and Mr. Williams will confirm what I say, that my good girl here\n",
      "will confer at least as much honour as she will receive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, you are inexpressibly generous; but I shall never think so.\n",
      "Why, my Pamela, said he, that's another thing: It will be best for me to\n",
      "think you will; and it will be kind in you to think you shan't; and then\n",
      "we shall always have an excellent rule to regulate our conduct by to one\n",
      "another.\n",
      "\n",

      "you know I took a bond for the money I had caused you to be troubled\n",
      "for: I really am ashamed of the matter; because I never intended, when\n",

      "what might happen between you and her, nor how far matters might have\n",

      "I think it is no extraordinary present, therefore, to give you up your\n",

      "him. I think, added he, all the charges attending it, and the trouble\n",
      "you had, were defrayed by my attorney; I ordered that they should. They\n",
      "were, sir, said he; and ten thousand thanks to you for this goodness,\n",
      "and the kind manner in which you do it.--If you will go, Mr. Williams,\n",
      "said he, shall my chariot carry you home? No, sir, answered he, I thank\n",

      "no more of it. But did I not hear the good man expressing some sort of\n",

      "had him take his choice. My poor father was quite confounded: for my\n",
      "master saw not any he thought too good, and my father none that he\n",
      "thought bad enough. And my good master, at last, (he fixed his eye upon\n",
      "a fine drab, which he thought looked the plainest,) would help him to\n",
      "try the coat and waistcoat on himself; and, indeed, one would not\n",
      "have thought it, because my master is taller, and rather plumper, as I\n",
      "thought but, as I saw afterwards, they fitted him very well. And being\n",
      "plain, and lined with the same colour, and made for travelling in a\n",
      "coach, pleased my poor father much. He gave him the whole suit, and,\n",
      "calling up Mrs. Jewkes, said, Let these clothes be well aired against\n",
      "tomorrow morning. Mr. Andrews brought only with him his common apparel,\n",
      "not thinking to stay Sunday with us. And pray see for some of my\n",
      "stockings, and whether any of my shoes will fit him: And see also for\n",
      "some of my linen; for we have put the good man quite out of his course,\n",
      "by keeping him Sunday over. He was then pleased to give him the silver\n",
      "buckles out of his own shoes. So, my good mother, you must expect to see\n",
      "my dear father a great beau. Wig, said my master, he wants none; for\n",
      "his own venerable white locks are better than all the perukes in\n",
      "England.--But I am sure I have hats enough somewhere.--I'll take care of\n",
      "every thing, sir, said Mrs. Jewkes.--And my poor father, when he came to\n",
      "me, could not refrain tears. I know not how, said he, to comport myself\n",

      "Mrs. Jewkes having often, on other days, in vain, besought her to sing\n",

      "believing Mrs. Jewkes had a design against her honour, and looking upon\n",
      "her as her gaoler, she thus gives her version of this psalm. But pray,\n",
      "Mr. Williams, do you read one verse of the common translation, and I\n",

      "that had befallen her daughter. When my master found him so desirous to\n",
      "go, he called Mr. Thomas, and ordered him to get a particular bay horse\n",
      "ready betimes in the morning, for my father, and a portmanteau, to put\n",
      "his things in; and to attend him a day's journey: And if, said he, Mr.\n",

      "He also said a great many kind things at supper-time, and gave him all\n",
      "the papers he had of mine; but desired, when he and my mother had read\n",
      "them, that he would return them to him again. And then he said, So\n",
      "affectionate a father and daughter may, perhaps, be glad to be alone\n",
      "together; therefore remember me to your good wife, and tell her, it\n",
      "will not be long, I hope, before I see you together; on a visit to your\n",
      "daughter, at my other house: and so I wish you good night, and a good\n",
      "journey, if you go before I see you. And then he shook hands, and left\n",

      "and goodness.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may believe, my dear mother, how loath I was to part with my\n",

      "for any thing, be seen in them in his neighbourhood, till I was actually\n",
      "known, by every body, to be married; nor would he lay out any part of\n",
      "the twenty guineas till then neither, for fear of reflections; and\n",
      "then he would consult me as to what he would buy. Well, said I, as you\n",

      "of hearing from one another, without needing any art or contrivances.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, He would go to bed betimes, that he might be up as soon as it\n",
      "was light; and so he took leave of me, and said, He would not love me,\n",
      "if I got up in the morning to see him go; which would but make us both\n",

      "same from you, my dear mother; and went up to my closet with a heavy\n",
      "heart, and yet a half-pleased one, if I may so say; for that, as he must\n",
      "go, he was going to the best of wives, and with the best of tidings.\n",
      "But I begged he would not work so hard as he had done; for I was sure\n",

      "him serviceable, to a degree equivalent, without hurting any body else.\n",

      "Now, Pamela, said he, tell me, if you can oblige me with the day. Your\n",
      "word is all that's wanting. I made bold to kiss his dear hand; and,\n",
      "though unable to look up, said--I know not what to say, sir, to all your\n",

      "capable of receiving negligently an honour, that all the duty of a long\n",
      "life, were it to be lent me, will not be sufficient to enable me to be\n",
      "grateful for. I ought to resign myself, in every thing I may or\n",
      "can, implicitly to your will. But--But what? said he, with a kind\n",
      "impatience.--Why, sir, said I, when from last Thursday you mentioned\n",
      "four days, I had reason to think that term your choice; and my heart\n",
      "is so wholly yours, that I am afraid of nothing, but that I may be\n",
      "forwarder than you wish. Impossible, my dear creature! said he, and\n",
      "folded me in his arms: Impossible! If this be all, it shall be set about\n",
      "this moment, and this happy day shall make you mine!--I'll send away\n",
      "instantly, said the dear gentleman; and was going.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, No, pray, sir, pray, sir, hear me!--Indeed it cannot be\n",
      "to-day!--Cannot! said he.--No, indeed, sir! said I--And was ready to\n",
      "sink to see his generous impatience. Why flattered you then my fond\n",
      "heart, replied he, with the hope that it might?--Sir, said I, I will\n",
      "tell you what I had thought, if you'll vouchsafe me your attention. Do\n",
      "then, said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have, sir, proceeded I, a great desire, that, whenever the day is,\n",
      "it may be on a Thursday: On a Thursday my dear father and mother were\n",
      "married; and, though poor, they are a very happy pair.--On a Thursday\n",
      "your poor Pamela was born. On a Thursday my dear good lady took me from\n",
      "my parents into her protection. On a Thursday, sir, you caused me to be\n",
      "carried away to this place, to which I now, by God's goodness, and your\n",
      "favour, owe so amazingly all my present prospects; and on a Thursday it\n",
      "was, you named to me, that fourteen days from that you would confirm my\n",
      "happiness. Now, sir, if you please to indulge my superstitious folly,\n",
      "you will greatly oblige me. I was sorry, sir, for this reason, when you\n",
      "bid me not defer till the last day of the fourteen, that Thursday in\n",
      "next week was that last day.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, Pamela, is a little superstitious, I must needs say; and I think\n",
      "you should begin now to make another day in the week a happy one; as for\n",
      "example; on a Monday, may you say, my father and mother concluded to be\n",
      "married on the Thursday following. On a Monday, so many years ago,\n",
      "my mother was preparing all her matters to be brought to bed on the\n",
      "Thursday following. On a Monday, several weeks ago, it was that you had\n",
      "but two days more to stay, till you was carried away on Thursday. On a\n",
      "Monday, I myself, said he, well remember, it was that I wrote you the\n",
      "letter, that prevailed on you so kindly to return to me; and on the same\n",
      "day you did return to my house here; which I hope, my girl, will be as\n",
      "propitious an era as any you have named: And now, lastly, will you say,\n",
      "which will crown the work; And, on a Monday I was married.--Come, come,\n",
      "my dear, added he, Thursday has reigned long enough o'conscience; let us\n",
      "now set Monday in its place, or at least on an equality with it, since\n",
      "you see it has a very good title, and as we now stand in the week before\n",
      "us, claims priority: And then, I hope, we shall make Tuesday, Wednesday,\n",
      "Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, as happy days as Monday and Thursday; and\n",
      "so, by God's blessing, move round, as the days move, in a delightful\n",
      "circle, till we are at a loss what day to prefer to the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "O how charmingly was this said!--And how sweetly kind!\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, sir, said I, you rally my folly very agreeably; but don't let a\n",
      "little matter stand in the way, when you are so generously obliging in a\n",
      "greater: Indeed I like Thursday best, if I may choose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, then, said he, if you can say you have a better reason than this,\n",
      "I will oblige you; else I'll send away for the parson this moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, I protest, he was going!--Dear sirs, how I trembled! Stay, stay,\n",
      "sir, said I: we have a great deal to say first; I have a deal of silly\n",
      "prate to trouble you with!--Well, say then, in a minute, replied he, the\n",
      "most material: for all we have to say may be talked of while the\n",
      "parson is coming.--O, but indeed, and indeed, said I, it cannot be\n",
      "to-day!--Well, then, shall it be to-morrow? said he.--Why, sir, if it\n",
      "must not be on a Thursday, you have given so many pleasant distinctions\n",
      "for a Monday, that let it then be next Monday.--What! a week still? said\n",
      "he. Sir, answered I, if you please; for that will be, as you enjoined,\n",
      "within the second seven days. Why, girl, said he, 'twill be seven months\n",
      "till next Monday. Let it, said he, if not to-morrow, be on Wednesday; I\n",
      "protest I will stay no longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, sir, returned I, please to defer it, however, for one day more,\n",
      "and it will be my beloved Thursday! If I consent to defer it till then,\n",
      "may I hope, my Pamela, said he, that next Thursday shall certainly be\n",
      "the happy day?--Yes, sir, said I and I am sure I looked very foolishly!\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, my dear father and mother, why should I, with such a fine\n",
      "gentleman? And whom I so dearly love? And so much to my honour too?\n",
      "But there is something greatly awful upon my mind, in the solemn\n",
      "circumstance, and a change of condition never to be recalled, though all\n",
      "the prospects are so desirable. And I can but wonder at the thoughtless\n",
      "precipitancy with which most young folks run into this important change\n",
      "of life!\n",
      "\n",
      "So now, my dear parents, have I been brought to fix so near a day as\n",
      "next Thursday; and this is Monday. O dear, it makes one out of breath\n",
      "almost to think of it! This, though, was a great cut off; a whole week\n",
      "out of ten days. I hope I am not too forward! I'm sure, if it obliges my\n",
      "dear master, I am justified; for he deserves of me all things in my poor\n",
      "power.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this, he rode out on horseback, attended by Abraham, and did not\n",
      "return till night. How by degrees things steal upon one! I thought even\n",
      "this small absence tedious; and the more, as we expected him home to\n",
      "dinner.--I wish I may not be too fond, and make him indifferent: But\n",
      "yet, my dear father and mother, you were always fond of one another, and\n",
      "never indifferent, let the world run as it would.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he returned, he said, He had had a pleasant ride, and was led out\n",
      "to a greater distance than he intended. At supper he told me, that he\n",
      "had a great mind Mr. Williams should marry us; because, he said, it\n",
      "would shew a thorough reconciliation on his part. But, said he, most\n",
      "generously, I am apprehensive, from what passed between you, that the\n",
      "poor man will take it hardly, and as a sort of insult, which I am not\n",
      "capable of. What says my girl?--Do you think he would? I hope not, sir,\n",
      "said I: As to what he may think, I can't answer; but as to any reason\n",
      "for his thoughts, I can: For indeed, sir, said I, you have been already\n",
      "so generous, that he cannot, I think, mistake your goodness.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then spoke with some resentment of Lady Davers's behaviour, and I\n",
      "asked, if any thing new had occurred? Yes, said he; I have had a\n",
      "letter delivered me from her impertinent husband, professedly at her\n",
      "instigation, that amounted to little less than a piece of insolent\n",
      "bravery, on supposing I was about to marry you. I was so provoked,\n",
      "added he, that after I had read it, I tore it in a hundred pieces, and\n",
      "scattered them in the air, and bid the man who brought it let his master\n",
      "know what I had done with his letter; and so would not permit him to\n",
      "speak to me, as he would fain have done,--I think the fellow talked\n",
      "somewhat of his lady coming hither; but she shall not set her foot\n",
      "within my doors; and I suppose this treatment will hinder her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was much concerned at this: And he said, Had I a hundred sisters,\n",
      "Pamela, their opposition should have no weight with me: and I did not\n",
      "intend you should know it; but you can't but expect a little difficulty\n",
      "from the pride of my sister, who have suffered so much from that of\n",
      "her brother; and we are too nearly allied in mind, as well as blood, I\n",
      "find.--But this is not her business: And if she would have made it so,\n",
      "she should have done it with more decency. Little occasion had she to\n",
      "boast of her birth, that knows not what belongs to good manners.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, I am very sorry, sir, to be the unhappy occasion of a\n",
      "misunderstanding between so good a brother and so worthy a sister. Don't\n",
      "say so, Pamela, because this is an unavoidable consequence of the\n",
      "happy prospect before us. Only bear it well yourself, because she is my\n",
      "sister; and leave it to me to make her sensible of her own rashness.\n",
      "\n",
      "If, sir, said I, the most lowly behaviour, and humble deportment, and in\n",
      "every thing shewing a dutiful regard to good Lady Davers, will have any\n",
      "weight with her ladyship, assure yourself of all in my power to mollify\n",
      "her. No, Pamela, returned he; don't imagine, when you are my wife, I\n",
      "will suffer you to do any thing unworthy of that character. I know the\n",
      "duty of a husband, and will protect your gentleness to the utmost, as\n",
      "much as if you were a princess by descent.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are inexpressibly good, sir, said I; but I am far from taking a\n",
      "gentle disposition to shew a meanness of spirit: And this is a trial I\n",
      "ought to expect; and well I may bear it, that have so many benefits to\n",
      "set against it, which all spring from the same cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said he, all the matter shall be this: We will talk of our\n",
      "marriage as a thing to be done next week. I find I have spies upon\n",
      "me wherever I go, and whatever I do: But now, I am on so laudable\n",
      "a pursuit, that I value them not, nor those who employ them. I have\n",
      "already ordered my servants to have no conference with any body for\n",
      "ten or twelve days to come. And Mrs. Jewkes tells me every one names\n",
      "Thursday come se'nnight for our nuptials. So I will get Mr. Peters, who\n",
      "wants to see my little chapel, to assist Mr. Williams, under the notion\n",
      "of breakfasting with me next Thursday morning, since you won't have it\n",
      "sooner; and there will nobody else be wanting; and I will beg of Mr.\n",
      "Peters to keep it private, even from his own family, for a few days. Has\n",
      "my girl any objection?\n",
      "\n",
      "O, sir, answered I, you are so generous in all your ways, I can have\n",
      "no objections!--But I hope Lady Davers and you will not proceed to\n",
      "irreconcilable lengths; and when her ladyship comes to see you, and to\n",
      "tarry with you, two or three weeks, as she used to do, I will keep close\n",
      "up, so as not to disgust her with the sight of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Pamela, said he, we will talk of that afterwards. You must do then\n",
      "as I shall think fit: And I shall be able to judge what both you and I\n",
      "ought to do. But what still aggravates the matter is, that she should\n",
      "instigate the titled ape her husband to write to me, after she had so\n",
      "little succeeded herself. I wish I had kept his letter, that I might\n",
      "have shewn you how a man, that generally acts like a fool, can take upon\n",
      "him to write like a lord. But I suppose it is of my sister's penning,\n",
      "and he, poor man! is the humble copier.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Thomas is returned from you, my dear father, with the good news\n",
      "of your health, and your proceeding in your journey to my dear mother,\n",
      "where I hope to hear soon you are arrived. My master has just now been\n",
      "making me play upon the spinnet, and sing to it; and was pleased to\n",
      "commend me for both. But he does so for every thing I do, so partial\n",
      "does his goodness make him to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One o'clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are just returned from an airing in the chariot; and I have\n",
      "been delighted with his conversation upon English authors, poets\n",
      "particularly. He entertained me also with a description of some of\n",
      "the curiosities he had seen in Italy and France, when he made what the\n",
      "polite world call the grand tour. He said he wanted to be at his other\n",
      "seat, for he knew not well how to employ himself here, having not\n",
      "proposed to stay half the time: And when I get there, Pamela, said he,\n",
      "you will hardly be troubled with so much of my company, after we have\n",
      "settled; for I have a great many things to adjust: And I must go to\n",
      "London; for I have accounts that have run on longer than ordinary with\n",
      "my banker there. And I don't know, added he, but the ensuing winter I\n",
      "may give you a little taste of the diversions of the town for a month\n",
      "or so. I said, His will and pleasure should determine mine; and I never\n",
      "would, as near as I could, have a desire after those, or any other\n",
      "entertainments that were not in his own choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was pleased to say, I make no doubt but that I shall be very happy\n",
      "in you; and hope you will be so in me: For, said he, I have no very\n",
      "enormous vices to gratify; though I pretend not to the greatest purity,\n",
      "neither, my girl. Sir, said I, if you can account to your own mind,\n",
      "I shall always be easy in whatever you do. But our greatest happiness\n",
      "here, sir, continued I, is of very short duration; and this life, at the\n",
      "longest, is a poor transitory one; and I hope we shall be so happy as\n",
      "to be enabled to look forward, with comfort, to another, where our\n",
      "pleasures will be everlasting.\n",
      "\n",
      "You say well, Pamela; and I shall, by degrees, be more habituated to\n",
      "this way of thinking, as I more and more converse with you; but, at\n",
      "present, you must not be over serious with me all at once: though\n",
      "I charge you never forbear to mingle your sweet divinity in our\n",
      "conversation, whenever it can be brought in a propos, and with such\n",
      "a cheerfulness of temper, as shall not throw a gloomy cloud over our\n",
      "innocent enjoyments.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was abashed at this, and silent, fearing I had offended: But he said,\n",
      "If you attend rightly to what I said, I need not tell you again, Pamela,\n",
      "not to be discouraged from suggesting to me, on every proper occasion,\n",
      "the pious impulses of your own amiable mind. Sir, said I, you will be\n",
      "always indulgent, I make no doubt, to my imperfections, so long as I\n",
      "mean well.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master made me dine with him, and would eat nothing but what I helped\n",
      "him to; and my heart is, every hour, more and more enlarged with his\n",
      "goodness and condescension. But still, what ails me, I wonder! A strange\n",
      "sort of weight hangs upon my mind, as Thursday draws on, which makes\n",
      "me often sigh involuntarily, and damps, at times, the pleasures of my\n",
      "delightful prospects!--I hope this is not ominous; but only the foolish\n",
      "weakness of an over-thoughtful mind, on an occasion the most solemn and\n",
      "important of one's life, next to the last scene, which shuts up all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could be very serious: But I will commit all my ways to that blessed\n",
      "Providence, which hitherto has so wonderfully conducted me through real\n",
      "evils to this hopeful situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I only fear, and surely I have great reason, that I shall be too\n",
      "unworthy to hold the affections of so dear a gentleman!--God teach me\n",
      "humility, and to know my own demerit! And this will be, next to his\n",
      "grace, my surest guard, in the state of life to which, though most\n",
      "unworthy, I am going to be exalted. And don't cease your prayers for\n",
      "me, my dear parents; for, perhaps, this new condition may be subject\n",
      "to still worse hazards than those I have escaped; as would be the case,\n",
      "were conceitedness, vanity, and pride, to take hold of my frail heart;\n",
      "and if I was, for my sins, to be left to my own conduct, a frail bark\n",
      "in a tempestuous ocean, without ballast, or other pilot than my own\n",
      "inconsiderate will. But my master said, on another occasion, That those\n",
      "who doubted most, always erred least; and I hope I shall always doubt my\n",
      "own strength, my own worthiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will not trouble you with twenty sweet agreeable things that passed in\n",

      "pleased with me, and with my conduct to them: And as my master,\n",
      "hitherto, finds no fault that I go too low, nor they that I carry it too\n",
      "high, I hope I shall continue to have every body's good-will: But yet\n",
      "will I not seek to gain any one's by little meannesses or debasements!\n",
      "but aim at an uniform and regular conduct, willing to conceal\n",
      "involuntary errors, as I would have my own forgiven; and not too\n",
      "industrious to discover real ones, or to hide such, if any such should\n",
      "appear, as might encourage bad hearts, or unclean hands, in material\n",
      "cases, where my master should receive damage, or where the morals of the\n",
      "transgressors should appear wilfully and habitually corrupt. In short, I\n",
      "will endeavour, as much as I can, that good servants shall find in me a\n",
      "kind encourager; indifferent ones be made better, by inspiring them with\n",
      "a laudable emulation; and bad ones, if not too bad in nature, and quite\n",
      "irreclaimable, reformed by kindness, expostulation, and even proper\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, my dear parents, I have but this one day between me and the most\n",
      "solemn rite that can be performed. My heart cannot yet shake off this\n",
      "heavy weight. Sure I am ungrateful to the divine goodness, and the\n",
      "favour of the best of benefactors!--Yet I hope I am not!--For, at times,\n",
      "my mind is all exultation, with the prospect of what good to-morrow's\n",
      "happy solemnity may possibly, by the leave of my generous master, put it\n",

      "Wednesday evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear master is all love and tenderness. He sees my weakness, and\n",
      "generously pities and comforts me! I begged to be excused supper; but\n",
      "he brought me down himself from my closet, and placed me by him, bidding\n",
      "Abraham not wait. I could not eat, and yet I tried, for fear he should\n",
      "be angry. He kindly forbore to hint any thing of the dreadful, yet\n",
      "delightful to-morrow! and put, now and then, a little bit on my plate,\n",
      "and guided it to my mouth. I was concerned to receive his goodness with\n",
      "so ill a grace. Well, said he, if you won't eat with me, drink at least\n",
      "with me: I drank two glasses by his over-persuasions, and said, I am\n",
      "really ashamed of myself. Why, indeed, said he, my dear girl, I am not\n",
      "a very dreadful enemy, I hope! I cannot bear any thing that is the least\n",
      "concerning to you. Oh, sir! said I, all is owing to the sense I have of\n",
      "my own unworthiness!--To be sure, it cannot be any thing else.\n",
      "\n",
      "He rung for the things to be taken away; and then reached a chair,\n",
      "and sat down by me, and put his kind arms about me, and said the most\n",
      "generous and affecting things that ever dropt from the honey-flowing\n",
      "mouth of love. All I have not time to repeat: some I will. And oh!\n",
      "indulge your foolish daughter, who troubles you with her weak nonsense;\n",
      "because what she has to say, is so affecting to her; and because, if she\n",
      "went to bed, instead of scribbling, she could not sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "This sweet confusion and thoughtfulness in my beloved Pamela, said\n",

      "doubts are cleared up, and nothing of dishonour is apprehended, shew me\n",
      "most abundantly, what a wretch I was to attempt such purity with a worse\n",
      "intention--No wonder, that one so virtuous should find herself deserted\n",
      "of life itself on a violence so dreadful to her honour, and seek a\n",
      "refuge in the shadow of death.--But now, my dearest Pamela, that you\n",
      "have seen a purity on my side, as nearly imitating your own, as our sex\n",
      "can shew to yours; and since I have, all the day long, suppressed even\n",
      "the least intimation of the coming days, that I might not alarm your\n",
      "tender mind; why all this concern, why all this affecting, yet sweet\n",
      "confusion? You have a generous friend, my dear girl, in me; a protector\n",
      "now, not a violator of your innocence: Why then, once more I ask, this\n",
      "strange perplexity, this sweet confusion?\n",
      "\n",
      "O sir, said I, and hid my face on his arm; expect not reason from a\n",
      "foolish creature: You should have still indulged me in my closet: I am\n",
      "ready to beat myself for this ungrateful return to your goodness. But\n",
      "I know not what!--I am, to be sure, a silly creature! O had you but\n",
      "suffered me to stay by myself above, I should have made myself ashamed\n",
      "of so culpable a behaviour!--But goodness added to goodness every\n",
      "moment, and the sense of my own unworthiness, quite overcome my spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, said the generous man, will I, though reluctantly, make a proposal\n",

      "day will still be more obliging: If you have fears you will not then\n",
      "have; you shall say but the word, and I'll submit. Yes, my Pamela; for\n",
      "though I have, these three days past, thought every tedious hour a day,\n",
      "till Thursday comes, if you earnestly desire it, I will postpone it.\n",
      "Say, my dear girl, freely say; but accept not my proposal, without great\n",
      "reason, which yet I will not ask for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, I can expect nothing but superlative goodness, I have been\n",
      "so long used to it from you. This is a most generous instance of it; but\n",
      "I fear--yes, I fear it will be too much the same thing, some days hence,\n",
      "when the happy, yet, fool that I am! dreaded time, shall be equally\n",
      "near!\n",
      "\n",
      "Kind, lovely charmer! said he, now do I see you are to be trusted with\n",
      "power, from the generous use you make of it!--Not one offensive word or\n",
      "look, from me, shall wound your nicest thoughts; but pray try to subdue\n",
      "this over-scrupulousness, and unseasonable timidity. I persuade myself\n",
      "you will if you can.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, sir, I will, said I; for I am quite ashamed of myself, with all\n",
      "these lovely views before me!--The honours you do me, the kindness you\n",
      "shew me!--I cannot forgive myself! For, oh! if I know the least of\n",
      "this idle foolish heart of mine, it has not a misgiving thought of\n",
      "your goodness; and I should abhor it, if it were capable of the least\n",
      "affectation.--But, dear good sir, leave me a little to myself, and I\n",
      "will take myself to a severer task than your goodness will let you do\n",
      "and I will present my heart before you, a worthier offering to you, than\n",
      "at present its wayward follies will let it seem to be.--But one thing\n",
      "is, one has no kind friend of one's own sex, to communicate one's\n",
      "foolish thoughts to, and to be strengthened by their comfortings! But I\n",
      "am left to myself; and, oh! what a weak silly thing I am!\n",
      "\n",
      "He kindly withdrew, to give me time to recollect myself; and in about\n",
      "half an hour returned: and then, that he might not begin at once upon\n",
      "the subject, and say, at the same time, something agreeable to me, said,\n",
      "Your father and mother have had a great deal of talk by this time about\n",
      "you, Pamela. O, sir, returned I, your goodness has made them quite\n",
      "happy! But I can't help being concerned about Lady Davers.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, I am vexed I did not hear the footman out; because it runs in\n",
      "my head he talked somewhat about her coming hither. She will meet with\n",
      "but an indifferent reception from me, unless she comes resolved to\n",
      "behave better than she writes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pray, sir, said I, be pleased to bear with my good lady, for two\n",
      "reasons. What are they? said he. Why, first, sir, answered I, because\n",
      "she is your sister; and, to be sure, may very well think, what all the\n",
      "world will, that you have much undervalued yourself in making me happy.\n",
      "And next, because, if her ladyship finds you out of temper with her, it\n",
      "will still aggravate her more against me; and every time that any warm\n",
      "words you may have between you, come into her mind, she will disdain me\n",
      "more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't concern yourself about it, said he; for we have more proud ladies\n",
      "than she in our other neighbourhood, who, perhaps, have still less\n",
      "reason to be punctilious about their descent, and yet will form\n",
      "themselves upon her example, and say, Why, his own sister will not\n",
      "forgive him, nor visit him! And so, if I can subdue her spirit, which is\n",
      "more than her husband ever could, or indeed any body else, it is a great\n",
      "point gained: And, if she gives me reason, I'll try for it, I assure\n",
      "you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, but, my dear girl, continued he, since the subject is so\n",
      "important, may I not say one word about to-morrow?--Sir, said I, I hope\n",
      "I shall be less a fool: I have talked as harshly to my heart, as Lady\n",
      "Davers can do; and the naughty thing suggests to me a better, and more\n",
      "grateful behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "He smiled, and, kissing me, said, I took notice, Pamela, of what you\n",
      "observed, that you have none of your own sex with you; I think it is a\n",
      "little hard upon you; and I should have liked you should have had Miss\n",
      "Darnford; but then her sister must have been asked; and I might as well\n",
      "make a public wedding: which, you know, would have required clothes and\n",
      "other preparations. Besides, added he, a foolish proposal was once made\n",
      "me of that second sister, who has two or three thousand pounds more than\n",
      "the other, left her by a godmother, and she can't help being a little\n",
      "piqued; though, said he, it was a proposal they could not expect should\n",
      "succeed; for there is nothing in her person nor mind; and her fortune,\n",
      "as that must have been the only inducement, would not do by any means;\n",
      "and so I discouraged it at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am thinking, sir, said I, of another mortifying thing too; that were\n",
      "you to marry a lady of birth and fortune answerable to your own, all\n",
      "the eve to the day would be taken up in reading, signing, and sealing of\n",
      "settlements, and portion, and such like: But now the poor Pamela brings\n",
      "you nothing at all: And the very clothes she wears, so very low is she,\n",
      "are entirely the effects of your bounty, and that of your good mother:\n",
      "This makes me a little sad: For, alas! sir, I am so much oppressed\n",
      "by your favours, and the sense of the obligations I lie under, that\n",
      "I cannot look up with the confidence that I otherwise should, on this\n",
      "awful occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is, my dear Pamela, said he, where the power is wanting, as much\n",
      "generosity in the will as in the action. To all that know your story,\n",
      "and your merit, it will appear that I cannot recompense you for what\n",
      "I have made you suffer. You have had too many hard struggles and\n",
      "exercises; and have nobly overcome: and who shall grudge you the reward\n",
      "of the hard-bought victory?--This affair is so much the act of my\n",
      "own will, that I glory in being capable of distinguishing so much\n",
      "excellence; and my fortune is the more pleasurable to me, as it gives\n",
      "me hope, that I may make you some part of satisfaction for what you have\n",
      "undergone.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, sir, said I, is all goodness, unmerited on my side; and makes my\n",
      "obligations the greater. I can only wish for more worthiness.--But how\n",
      "poor is it to offer nothing but words for such generous deeds!--And to\n",
      "say, I wish!--For what is a wish, but the acknowledged want of power to\n",
      "oblige, and a demonstration of one's poverty in every thing but will?\n",
      "\n",
      "And that, my dear girl, said he, is every thing: 'Tis all I want: 'Tis\n",
      "all that Heaven itself requires of us: But no more of these little\n",
      "doubts, though they are the natural impulses of a generous and grateful\n",
      "heart: I want not to be employed in settlements. Those are for such to\n",
      "regard, who make convenience and fortune the prime considerations. I\n",
      "have possessions ample enough for us both; and you deserve to share\n",
      "them with me; and you shall do it, with as little reserve, as if you\n",
      "had brought me what the world reckons an equivalent: for, as to my own\n",
      "opinion, you bring me what is infinitely more valuable, an experienced\n",
      "truth, a well-tried virtue, and a wit and behaviour more than equal to\n",
      "the station you will be placed in: To say nothing of this sweet person,\n",
      "that itself might captivate a monarch; and of the meekness of temper,\n",
      "and sweetness of disposition, which make you superior to all the women I\n",
      "ever saw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus kind and soothing, and honourably affectionate, was the dear\n",
      "gentleman, to the unworthy, doubting, yet assured Pamela; and thus\n",
      "patiently did he indulge, and generously pardon, my impertinent\n",
      "weakness. He offered to go himself to Lady Jones, in the morning, and\n",
      "reveal the matter to her, and desire her secrecy and presence; but I\n",
      "said, That would disoblige the young Ladies Darnford. No, sir, said I, I\n",
      "will cast myself upon your generous kindness; for why should I fear the\n",
      "kind protector of my weakness, and the guide and director of my future\n",
      "steps?\n",
      "\n",
      "You cannot, said he, forgive Mrs. Jewkes; for she must know it; and\n",
      "suffer her to be with you? Yes, sir, said I, I can. She is very civil\n",
      "to me now: and her former wickedness I will forgive, for the sake of the\n",
      "happy fruits that have attended it; and because you mention her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said he, I will call her in, if you please.--As you please, sir,\n",
      "said I. And he rung for her; and when she came in, he said, Mrs. Jewkes,\n",
      "I am going to entrust you with a secret. Sir, answered she, I will be\n",
      "sure to keep it as such. Why, said he, we intend to-morrow, privately as\n",
      "possible, for our wedding-day; and Mr. Peters and Mr. Williams are to be\n",
      "here, as to breakfast with me, and to shew Mr. Peters my little chapel.\n",
      "As soon as the ceremony is over, we will take a little airing in the\n",
      "chariot, as we have done at other times; and so it will not be wondered\n",
      "that we are dressed. And the two parsons have promised secrecy, and will\n",
      "go home. I believe you can't well avoid letting one of the maids into\n",
      "the secret; but that I'll leave to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, replied she, we all concluded it would be in a few days! and I\n",
      "doubt it won't be long a secret. No, said he, I don't desire it should;\n",
      "but you know we are not provided for a public wedding, and I shall\n",
      "declare it when we go to Bedfordshire, which won't be long. But the men,\n",
      "who lie in the outhouses, need not know it; for, by some means or other,\n",
      "my sister Davers knows all that passes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you know, sir, said she, that her ladyship intends to be down here\n",
      "with you in a few days? Her servant told me so, who brought you the\n",
      "letter you were angry at.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope, said he, we shall be set out for t'other house first; and shall\n",
      "be pleased she loses her labour. Sir, continued she, her ladyship,\n",
      "proposes to be here time enough to hinder your nuptials, which she\n",
      "takes, as we did, will be the latter end of next week. Well, said he,\n",
      "let her come: but yet I desire not to see her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes said to me, Give me leave, madam, to wish you all manner\n",
      "of happiness: But I am afraid I have too well obeyed his honour, to be\n",
      "forgiven by you. Indeed, Mrs. Jewkes, returned I, you will be more\n",
      "your own enemy than I will be. I will look all forward: and shall not\n",
      "presume, so much as by a whisper, to set my good master against any one\n",
      "he pleases to approve of: And as to his old servants, I shall always\n",
      "value them, and never offer to dictate to his choice, or influence it by\n",
      "my own caprices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes, said my master, you find you have no cause to apprehend\n",
      "any thing. My Pamela is very placable; and as we have both been sinners\n",
      "together, we must both be included in one act of grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such an example of condescension, as I have before me, Mrs. Jewkes, said\n",
      "I, may make you very easy; for I must be highly unworthy, if I did not\n",
      "forego all my little resentments, if I had any, for the sake of so much\n",
      "goodness to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are very kind, madam, said she; and you may depend upon it, I will\n",
      "atone for all my faults, by my future duty and respect to you, as well\n",
      "as to my master.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's well said on both sides, said he: but, Mrs. Jewkes, to assure\n",
      "you, that my good girl here has no malice, she chooses you to attend\n",
      "her in the morning at the ceremony, and you must keep up her spirits.--I\n",
      "shall, replied she, be very proud of the honour: But I cannot, madam,\n",
      "but wonder to see you so very low-spirited, as you have been these two\n",
      "or three days past, with so much happiness before you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, Mrs. Jewkes, answered I, there can be but one reason given;\n",
      "and that is, that I am a sad fool!--But, indeed, I am not ungrateful\n",
      "neither; nor would I put on a foolish affectation: But my heart, at\n",
      "times, sinks within me; I know not why, except at my own unworthiness,\n",
      "and because the honour done me is too high for me to support myself\n",
      "under, as I should do. It is an honour, Mrs. Jewkes, added I, I was not\n",
      "born to; and no wonder, then, I behave so awkwardly. She made me a\n",
      "fine compliment upon it, and withdrew, repeating her promises of care,\n",
      "secrecy, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "He parted from me with very great tenderness; and I came up and set to\n",
      "writing, to amuse my thoughts, and wrote thus far. And Mrs. Jewkes being\n",
      "come up, and it being past twelve, I will go to bed; but not one wink, I\n",
      "fear, shall I get this night.--I could beat myself for anger. Sure\n",
      "there is nothing ominous in this strange folly!--But I suppose all young\n",
      "maidens are the same, so near so great a change of condition, though\n",
      "they carry it off more discreetly than I.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thursday, six o'clock in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "I might as well have not gone to bed last night, for what sleep I had.\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes often was talking to me, and said several things that would\n",
      "have been well enough from any body else of our sex; but the poor woman\n",
      "has so little purity of heart, that it is all say from her, and goes no\n",
      "farther than the ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "I fancy my master has not slept much neither; for I heard him up, and\n",
      "walking about his chamber, ever since break of day. To be sure, good\n",
      "gentleman! he must have some concern, as well as I; for here he is going\n",
      "to marry a poor foolish unworthy girl, brought up on the charity, as one\n",
      "may say, (at least bounty,) of his worthy family! And this foolish girl\n",
      "must be, to all intents and purposes, after twelve o'clock this day, as\n",
      "much his wife, as if he were to marry a duchess!--And here he must stand\n",
      "the shocks of common reflection! The great Mr. B---- has done finely! he\n",
      "has married his poor servant wench! will some say. The ridicule and rude\n",
      "jests of his equals, and companions too, he must stand: And the disdain\n",
      "of his relations, and indignation of Lady Davers, his lofty sister! Dear\n",
      "good gentleman! he will have enough to do, to be sure! O how shall I\n",
      "merit all these things at his hand! I can only do the best I can; and\n",
      "pray to God to reward him; and resolve to love him with a pure heart,\n",
      "and serve him with a sincere obedience. I hope the dear gentleman will\n",
      "continue to love me for this; for, alas! I have nothing else to offer!\n",
      "But, as I can hardly expect so great a blessing, if I can be secure\n",
      "from his contempt, I shall not be unfortunate; and must bear his\n",
      "indifference, if his rich friends should inspire him with it, and\n",
      "proceed with doing my duty with cheerfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Half an hour past eight o'clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "My good dear master, my kind friend, my generous benefactor, my worthy\n",
      "protector, and, oh! all the good words in one, my affectionate husband,\n",
      "that is soon to be--(be curbed in, my proud heart, know thy self, and\n",
      "be conscious of thy unworthiness!)--has just left me, with the kindest,\n",
      "tenderest expressions, and gentlest behaviour, that ever blest a happy\n",
      "maiden. He approached me with a sort of reined-in rapture. My Pamela!\n",
      "said he, May I just ask after your employment? Don't let me chide my\n",
      "dear girl this day, however. The two parsons will be here to breakfast\n",
      "with us at nine; and yet you are not a bit dressed! Why this absence of\n",
      "mind, and sweet irresolution?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, indeed, sir, said I, I will set about a reformation this instant.\n",
      "He saw the common-prayer book lying in the window. I hope, said he, my\n",
      "lovely maiden has been conning the lesson she is by-and-by to repeat.\n",
      "Have you not, Pamela? and clasped his arms about me, and kissed me.\n",
      "Indeed, sir, said I, I have been reading over the solemn service.--And\n",
      "what thinks my fairest (for so he called me) of it?--O sir, 'tis very\n",
      "awful, and makes one shudder, to reflect upon it!--No wonder, said\n",
      "he, it should affect my sweet Pamela: I have been looking into it this\n",
      "morning, and I can't say but I think it a solemn, but very suitable\n",
      "service. But this I tell my dear love, continued he, and again clasped\n",
      "me to him, there is not a tittle in it that I cannot joyfully subscribe\n",
      "to: And that, my dear Pamela, should make you easy, and join cheerfully\n",
      "in it with me. I kissed his dear hand: O my generous, kind protector,\n",
      "said I, how gracious is it to confirm thus the doubting mind of your\n",
      "poor servant! which apprehends nothing so much as her own unworthiness\n",
      "of the honour and blessing that await her!--He was pleased to say, I\n",
      "know well, my dearest creature, that, according to the liberties we\n",
      "people of fortune generally give ourselves, I have promised a great\n",
      "deal, when I say so. But I would not have said it, if, deliberately,\n",
      "I could not with all my heart. So banish from your mind all doubt and\n",
      "uneasiness; let a generous confidence in me take place; and let me see\n",
      "it does, by your cheerfulness in this day's solemn business; and then I\n",
      "will love you for ever!\n",
      "\n",
      "May God Almighty, sir, said I, reward all your goodness to me!--That is\n",
      "all I can say. But, oh! how kind it is in you, to supply the want of the\n",
      "presence and comfortings of a dear mother, of a loving sister, or of the\n",
      "kind companions of my own sex, which most maidens have, to soothe their\n",
      "anxieties on the so near approach of so awful a solemnity!--You, sir,\n",
      "are all these tender relations in one to me! Your condescensions and\n",
      "kindness shall, if possible, embolden me to look up to you without\n",
      "that sweet terror, that must confound poor bashful maidens, on such an\n",
      "occasion, when they are surrendered up to a more doubtful happiness, and\n",
      "to half-strange men, whose good faith, and good usage of them, must be\n",
      "less experienced, and is all involved in the dark bosom of futurity, and\n",
      "only to be proved by the event.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, my dear Pamela, said he, is most kindly said! It shews me that you\n",
      "enter gratefully into my intention. For I would, by my conduct, supply\n",
      "all these dear relations to you; and I voluntarily promise, from my\n",
      "heart, to you, what I think I could not, with such assured resolutions\n",
      "of performance, to the highest-born lady in the kingdom. For let me tell\n",
      "my sweet girl, that, after having been long tossed by the boisterous\n",
      "winds of a more culpable passion, I have now conquered it, and am not\n",
      "so much the victim of your beauty, all charming as you are, as of your\n",
      "virtue; and therefore may more boldly promise for myself, having so\n",
      "stable a foundation for my affection; which, should this outward beauty\n",
      "fail, will increase with your virtue, and shine forth the brighter,\n",
      "as that is more illustriously displayed by the augmented opportunities\n",
      "which the condition you are now entering into will afford you.--O the\n",
      "dear charming man! how nobly, how encouragingly kind, was all this!\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not suitably express myself: And he said, I see my girl is at a\n",
      "loss for words! I doubt not your kind acceptance of my declarations. And\n",
      "when I have acted too much the part of a libertine formerly, for you\n",
      "to look back without some anxiety, I ought not, being now happily\n",
      "convicted, to say less.--But why loses my girl her time? I will now only\n",
      "add, that I hope for many happy years to make good, by my conduct, what\n",
      "so willingly flows from my lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "He kissed me again, and said, But, whatever you do, Pamela, be cheerful;\n",
      "for else, may be, of the small company we shall have, some one, not\n",
      "knowing how to account for your too nice modesty, will think there is\n",
      "some other person in the world, whose addresses would be still more\n",
      "agreeable to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "This he said with an air of sweetness and pleasantry; but it alarmed\n",
      "me exceedingly, and made me resolve to appear as calm and cheerful as\n",
      "possible. For this was, indeed, a most affecting expression, and enough\n",
      "to make me, if any thing can, behave as I ought, and to force my idle\n",
      "fears to give way to hopes so much better grounded.--And I began almost,\n",
      "on this occasion, to wish Mr. Williams were not to marry me, lest I\n",
      "should behave like a fool; and so be liable to an imputation, which I\n",
      "should be most unworthy, if I deserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I set about dressing me instantly; and he sent Mrs. Jewkes to assist\n",
      "me. But I am never long a dressing, when I set about it; and my master\n",
      "has now given me a hint, that will, for half an hour more, at least,\n",
      "keep my spirits in a brisk circulation. Yet it concerns me a little too,\n",
      "lest he should have any the least shadow of a doubt, that I am not, mind\n",
      "and person, entirely his.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so being now ready, and not called to breakfast, I sat down and\n",
      "wrote thus far.\n",
      "\n",
      "I might have mentioned, that I dressed myself in a rich white satin\n",
      "night-gown, that had been my good lady's, and my best head-clothes, etc.\n",
      "I have got such a knack of writing, that when I am by myself, I cannot\n",
      "sit without a pen in my hand.--But I am now called to breakfast. I\n",
      "suppose the gentlemen are come.--Now, courage, Pamela! Remember thou\n",
      "art upon thy good behaviour!--Fie upon it! my heart begins to flutter\n",
      "again!--Foolish heart! be still! Never, sure, was any maiden's perverse\n",
      "heart under so little command as mine!--It gave itself away, at first,\n",
      "without my leave; it has been, for weeks, pressing me with its wishes;\n",
      "and yet now, when it should be happy itself, and make me so, it is\n",
      "throb, throb, throb, like a little fool! and filling me with such\n",
      "unseasonable misgivings, as abate the rising comforts of all my better\n",
      "prospects.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thursday, near three o'clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought I should have found no time nor heart to write again this day.\n",
      "But here are three gentlemen come, unexpectedly, to dine with my master;\n",
      "and so I shall not appear. He has done all he could, civilly, to send\n",
      "them away; but they will stay, though I believe he had rather they would\n",
      "not. And so I have nothing to do but to write till I go to dinner myself\n",
      "with Mrs. Jewkes: for my master was not prepared for this company; and\n",
      "it will be a little latish to-day. So I will begin with my happy story\n",
      "where I left off.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I came down to breakfast, Mr. Peters and Mr. Williams were both\n",
      "there. And as soon as my master heard me coming down, he met me at the\n",
      "door, and led me in with great tenderness. He had kindly spoken to them,\n",
      "as he told me afterwards, to mention no more of the matter to me, than\n",
      "needs must. I paid my respects to them, I believe a little awkwardly,\n",
      "and was almost out of breath: but said, I had come down a little too\n",
      "fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Abraham came in to wait, my master said, (that the servants should\n",
      "not mistrust,) 'Tis well, gentlemen, you came as you did; for my good\n",
      "girl and I were going to take an airing till dinner-time. I hope you'll\n",
      "stay and dine with me. Sir, said Mr. Peters, we won't hinder your\n",
      "airing. I only came, having a little time upon my hands, to see your\n",
      "chapel; but must be at home at dinner; and Mr. Williams will dine with\n",
      "me. Well then, said my master, we will pursue our intention, and ride\n",
      "out for an hour or two, as soon as I have shewn Mr. Peters my little\n",
      "chapel. Will you, Pamela, after breakfast, walk with us to it? If,\n",
      "if, said I, and had like to have stammered, foolish that I was! if you\n",
      "please, sir. I could look none of them in the face. Abraham looking at\n",
      "me; Why, child, said my master, you have hardly recovered your fright\n",
      "yet: how came your foot to slip? 'Tis well you did not hurt yourself.\n",
      "Said Mr. Peters, improving the hint, You ha'n't sprained your ancle,\n",
      "madam, I hope. No, sir, said I, I believe not; but 'tis a little painful\n",
      "to me. And so it was; for I meant my foolishness! Abraham, said my\n",
      "master, bid Robin put the horses to the coach, instead of the chariot;\n",
      "and if these gentlemen will go, we can set them down. No matter, sir,\n",
      "said Mr. Peters: I had as lieve walk, if Mr. Williams chooses it. Well\n",
      "then, said my master, let it be the chariot, as I told him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could eat nothing, though I attempted it; and my hand shook so, I\n",
      "spilled some of my chocolate, and so put it down again; and they were\n",
      "all very good, and looked another way. My master said, when Abraham was\n",
      "out, I have a quite plain ring here, Mr. Peters: And I hope the ceremony\n",
      "will dignify the ring; and that I shall give my girl reason to think\n",
      "it, for that cause, the most valuable one that can be presented her. Mr.\n",
      "Peters said, He was sure I should value it more than the richest diamond\n",
      "in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had bid Mrs. Jewkes not to dress herself, lest she should give cause\n",
      "of mistrust; and she took my advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "When breakfast was over, my master said, before Abraham, Well,\n",
      "gentlemen, we will step into the chapel; and you must give me your\n",
      "advice, as to the alterations I design. I am in the more haste, because\n",
      "the survey you are going to take of it, for the alterations, will take\n",
      "up a little time; and we shall have but a small space between that and\n",
      "dinner, for the little tour I design to make.--Pamela, you'll give us\n",
      "your opinion, won't you? Yes, sir, said I; I'll come after you.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they went out, and I sat down in the chair again, and fanned myself:\n",
      "I am sick at heart, said I, I think, Mrs. Jewkes. Said she, Shall\n",
      "I fetch you a little cordial?--No, said I, I am a sad fool! I want\n",
      "spirits, that's all. She took her smelling-bottle, and would have given\n",
      "it me: but I said, Keep it in your hand; may be I shall want it: but I\n",
      "hope not.\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave me very good words, and begged me to go: And I got up; but my\n",
      "knees beat so against one another, I was forced to sit down again. But,\n",
      "at last, I held by her arm, and passing by Abraham, I said, This ugly\n",
      "slip, coming down stairs, has made me limp, though; so I must hold by\n",
      "you, Mrs. Jewkes. Do you know what alterations there are to be in the\n",
      "chapel, that we must all give our opinions of them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nan, she told me, was let into the secret; and she had ordered her to\n",
      "stay at the chapel door, to see that nobody came in. My dear master came\n",
      "to me, at entering the chapel, and took my hand, and led me up to the\n",
      "altar. Remember, my dear girl, whispered he, and be cheerful. I am,\n",
      "I will, sir, said I; but I hardly knew what I said; and so you may\n",
      "believe, when I said to Mrs. Jewkes, Don't leave me; pray, Mrs. Jewkes,\n",
      "don't leave me; as if I had all confidence in her, and none where it was\n",
      "most due. So she kept close to me. God forgive me! but I never was so\n",
      "absent in my life, as at first; even till Mr. Williams had gone on in\n",
      "the service, so far as to the awful words about requiring us, as we\n",
      "should answer at the dreadful day of judgment; and then the solemn\n",
      "words, and my master's whispering, Mind this, my dear, made me start.\n",
      "Said he, still whispering, Know you any impediment? I blushed, and said\n",
      "softly, None, sir, but my great unworthiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then followed the sweet words, Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded\n",
      "wife? etc. and I began to take heart a little, when my dearest master\n",
      "answered, audibly, to this question, I will. But I could only make a\n",
      "courtesy, when they asked me; though, I am sure, my heart was readier\n",
      "than my speech, and answered to every article of obey, serve, love, and\n",
      "honour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Peters gave me away; and I said, after Mr. Williams, as well as\n",
      "I could, as my dear master did with a much better grace, the words of\n",
      "betrothment; and the ceremony of the ring passing next, I received the\n",
      "dear favour at his worthy hands with a most grateful heart; and he was\n",
      "pleased to say afterwards in the chariot, that when he had done saying,\n",
      "With this ring I thee wed, etc. I made a courtesy, and said, Thank you,\n",
      "sir. May be I did; for I am sure it was a most grateful part of the\n",
      "service, and my heart was overwhelmed with his goodness, and the tender\n",
      "grace wherewith he performed it. I was very glad, that the next part\n",
      "was the prayer, and kneeling; for I trembled so, I could hardly stand,\n",
      "betwixt fear and joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The joining of our hands afterwards, the declaration of our being\n",
      "married to the few witnesses present; for, reckoning Nan, whose\n",
      "curiosity would not let her stay at the door, there were but Mr. Peters,\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes, and she; the blessing, the psalm, and the subsequent\n",
      "prayers, and the concluding exhortation; were so many beautiful,\n",
      "welcome, and lovely parts of this divine office, that my heart began to\n",
      "be delighted with them; and my spirits to be a little freer.\n",
      "\n",
      "And thus, my dearest, dear parents, is your happy, happy, thrice happy\n",
      "Pamela, at last married; and to whom?--Why, to her beloved, gracious\n",
      "master! the lord of her wishes! And thus the dear, once naughty assailer\n",
      "of her innocence, by a blessed turn of Providence, is become the kind,\n",
      "the generous protector and rewarder of it. God be evermore blessed\n",
      "and praised! and make me not wholly unworthy of such a transcendent\n",
      "honour!--And bless and reward the dear, dear, good gentleman, who has\n",
      "thus exalted his unworthy servant, and given her a place, which the\n",
      "greatest ladies would think themselves happy in!\n",
      "\n",
      "My master saluted me most ardently, and said, God give you, my dear\n",
      "love, as much joy on this occasion, as I have! And he presented me to\n",
      "Mr. Peters, who saluted me; and said, You may excuse me, dear madam,\n",
      "for I gave you away, and you are my daughter. And Mr. Williams modestly\n",
      "withdrawing a little way; Mr. Williams, said my master, pray accept my\n",
      "thanks, and wish your sister joy. So he saluted me too; and said, Most\n",
      "heartily, madam, I do. And I will say, that to see so much innocence and\n",
      "virtue so eminently rewarded, is one of the greatest pleasures I have\n",
      "ever known. This my master took very kindly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes would have kissed my hand at the chapel-door; but I put my\n",
      "arms about her neck, for I had got a new recruit of spirits just then;\n",
      "and kissed her, and said, Thank you, Mrs. Jewkes, for accompanying me. I\n",
      "have behaved sadly. No, madam, said she, pretty well, pretty well!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Peters walked out with me; and Mr. Williams and my master came out\n",
      "after us, talking together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Peters, when we came into the parlour, said, I once more, madam,\n",
      "must wish you joy on this happy occasion. I wish every day may add to\n",
      "your comforts; and may you very long rejoice in one another! for you are\n",
      "the loveliest couple I ever saw joined. I told him, I was highly obliged\n",
      "to his kind opinion, and good wishes; and hoped my future conduct would\n",
      "not make me unworthy of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "My good benefactor came in with Mr. Williams: So, my dear life, said he,\n",
      "how do you do? A little more composed, I hope. Well, you see this is not\n",
      "so dreadful an affair as you apprehended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said Mr. Peters, very kindly, it is a very solemn circumstance; and\n",
      "I love to see it so reverently and awfully entered upon. It is a most\n",
      "excellent sign; for the most thoughtful beginnings make the most prudent\n",
      "proceedings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes, of her own accord, came in with a large silver tumbler,\n",
      "filled with sack, and a toast, and nutmeg, and sugar; and my master\n",
      "said, That's well thought of, Mrs. Jewkes; for we have made but sorry\n",
      "breakfasting. And he would make me, take some of the toast; as they all\n",
      "did, and drank pretty heartily: and I drank a little, and it cheered my\n",
      "heart, I thought, for an hour after.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master took a fine diamond ring from his finger, and presented it to\n",
      "Mr. Peters, who received it very kindly. And to Mr. Williams he said,\n",
      "My old acquaintance, I have reserved for you, against a variety of\n",
      "solicitations, the living I always designed for you; and I beg you'll\n",
      "prepare to take possession of it; and as the doing it may be attended\n",
      "with some expense, pray accept of this towards it; and so he gave him\n",
      "(as he told me afterwards it was) a bank note of 50l.\n",
      "\n",
      "So did this generous good gentleman bless us all, and me in particular;\n",
      "for whose sake he was as bounteous as if he had married one of the\n",
      "noblest fortunes.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he took his leave of the gentlemen, recommending secrecy again, for\n",
      "a few days, and they left him; and none of the servants suspected any\n",
      "thing, as Mrs. Jewkes believes. And then I threw myself at his feet,\n",
      "blessed God, and blessed him for his goodness; and he overwhelmed me\n",
      "with kindness, calling me his sweet bride, and twenty lovely epithets,\n",
      "that swell my grateful heart beyond the power of utterance.\n",
      "\n",
      "He afterwards led me to the chariot; and we took a delightful tour round\n",
      "the neighbouring villages; and he did all he could to dissipate those\n",
      "still perverse anxieties that dwell upon my mind, and, do what I can,\n",
      "spread too thoughtful an air, as he tells me, over my countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "We came home again by half an hour after one; and he was pleasing\n",
      "himself with thinking, not to be an hour out of my company this blessed\n",
      "day, that (as he was so good as to say) he might inspire me with a\n",
      "familiarity that should improve my confidence in him, when he was told,\n",
      "that a footman of Sir Charles Hargrave had been here, to let him know,\n",
      "that his master, and two other gentlemen, were on the road to take a\n",
      "dinner with him, in their way to Nottingham.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was heartily vexed at this, and said to me, He should have been\n",
      "glad of their companies at any other time; but that it was a barbarous\n",
      "intrusion now; and he wished they had been told he would not be at home\n",
      "at dinner: And besides, said he, they are horrid drinkers; and I shan't\n",
      "be able to get them away to-night, perhaps; for they have nothing to do,\n",
      "but to travel round the country, and beat up their friends' quarters all\n",
      "the way; and it is all one to them, whether they stay a night or a month\n",
      "at a place. But, added he, I'll find some way, if I can, to turn them\n",
      "off, after dinner.--Confound them, said he, in a violent pet, that they\n",
      "should come this day, of all the days in the year!\n",
      "\n",
      "We had hardly alighted, and got in, before they came: Three mad rakes\n",
      "they seemed to be, as I looked through the window, setting up a hunting\n",
      "note, as soon as they came to the gate, that made the court-yard echo\n",
      "again; and smacking their whips in concert.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I went up to my chamber, and saw (what made my heart throb) Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes's officious pains to put the room in order for a guest, that,\n",
      "however welcome, as now my duty teaches me to say, is yet dreadful to me\n",
      "to think of. So I took refuge in my closet, and had recourse to pen and\n",
      "ink, for my amusement, and to divert my anxiety of mind.--If one's\n",
      "heart is so sad, and one's apprehension so great, where one so extremely\n",
      "loves, and is so extremely obliged; what must be the case of those poor\n",
      "maidens, who are forced, for sordid views, by their tyrannical parents\n",
      "or guardians, to marry the man they almost hate, and, perhaps, to the\n",
      "loss of the man they most love! O that is a sad thing, indeed!--And what\n",
      "have not such cruel parents to answer for! And what do not such poor\n",
      "innocent victims suffer!--But, blessed be God, this lot is far from\n",
      "being mine!\n",
      "\n",
      "My good master (for I cannot yet have the presumption to call him by a\n",
      "more tender name) came up to me, and said, Well, I just come to ask my\n",
      "dear bride (O the charming, charming word!) how she does? I see you are\n",
      "writing, my dear, said he. These confounded rakes are half mad, I think,\n",
      "and will make me so! However, said he, I have ordered my chariot to be\n",
      "got ready, as if I was under an engagement five miles off, and will set\n",
      "them out of the house, if possible; and then ride round, and come back,\n",
      "as soon as I can get rid of them. I find, said he, Lady Davers is full\n",
      "of our affairs. She has taken great freedoms with me before Sir Charles;\n",
      "and they have all been at me, without mercy; and I was forced to be very\n",
      "serious with them, or else they would have come up to have seen you,\n",
      "since I would not call you down.--He kissed me, and said, I shall\n",
      "quarrel with them, if I can't get them away; for I have lost two or\n",
      "three precious hours with my soul's delight: And so he went down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes asked me to walk down to dinner in the little parlour. I\n",
      "went down, and she was so complaisant as to offer to wait upon me at\n",
      "table; and would not be persuaded, without difficulty, to sit down\n",
      "with me. But I insisted she should: For, said I, it would be very\n",
      "extraordinary, if one should so soon go into such distance, Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes.--Whatever my new station may require of me, added I, I hope I\n",
      "shall always conduct myself in such a manner, that pride and insolence\n",
      "shall bear no part in my character.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are very good, madam, said she; but I will always know my duty to\n",
      "my master's lady.--Why then, replied I, if I must take state upon me so\n",
      "early, Mrs. Jewkes, let me exact from you what you call your duty; and\n",
      "sit down with me when I desire you.\n",
      "\n",
      "This prevailed upon her; and I made shift to get down a bit of\n",
      "apple-pye, and a little custard; but that was all.\n",
      "\n",
      "My good master came in again, and said, Well, thank my stars! these\n",
      "rakes are going now; but I must set out with them, and I choose my\n",
      "chariot; for if I took horse, I should have difficulty to part with\n",
      "them; for they are like a snowball, and intend to gather company as they\n",
      "go, to make a merry tour of it for some days together.\n",
      "\n",
      "We both got up, when he came in: Fie, Pamela! said he; why this ceremony\n",
      "now?--Sit still, Mrs. Jewkes.--Nay, sir, said she, I was loath to sit\n",
      "down; but my lady would have me.--She is very right, Mrs. Jewkes, said\n",
      "my master, and tapped me on the cheek; for we are but yet half married;\n",
      "and so she is not above half your lady yet!--Don't look so down, don't\n",
      "be so silent, my dearest, said he; why, you hardly spoke twenty words\n",
      "to me all the time we were out together. Something I will allow for your\n",
      "bashful sweetness; but not too much.--Mrs. Jewkes, have you no pleasant\n",
      "tales to tell my Pamela, to make her smile, till I return?--Yes, sir,\n",
      "said she, I could tell twenty pleasant stories; but my lady is too nice\n",
      "to hear them; and yet, I hope, I should not be shocking neither. Ah!\n",
      "poor woman! thought I; thy chastest stories will make a modest person\n",
      "blush, if I know thee! and I desire to hear none of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master said, Tell her one of the shortest you have, in my hearing.\n",
      "Why, sir, said she, I knew a bashful young lady, as madam may be,\n",
      "married to--Dear Mrs. Jewkes, interrupted I, no more of your story, I\n",
      "beseech you; I don't like the beginning of it. Go on, Mrs. Jewkes, said\n",
      "my master. No, pray, sir, don't require it, said I, pray don't. Well,\n",
      "said he, then we'll have it another time, Mrs. Jewkes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abraham coming in to tell him the gentlemen were going, and that his\n",
      "chariot was ready; I am glad of that, said he; and went to them, and set\n",
      "out with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took a turn in the garden with Mrs. Jewkes, after they were gone: And\n",
      "having walked a while, I said, I should be glad of her company down the\n",
      "elm-walk, to meet the chariot: For, O! I know not how to look up at him,\n",
      "when he is with me; nor how to bear his absence, when I have reason to\n",
      "expect him: What a strange contradiction there is in this unaccountable\n",
      "passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a different aspect every thing in and about this house bears now,\n",
      "to my thinking, to what it once had! The garden, the pond, the alcove,\n",
      "the elm-walk. But, oh! my prison is become my palace; and no wonder\n",
      "every thing wears another face!\n",
      "\n",
      "We sat down upon the broad stile, leading towards the road; and Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes was quite another person to me, to what she was the last time I\n",
      "sat there.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last my best beloved returned, and alighted there. What, my Pamela!\n",
      "(and Mrs. Jewkes then left me,) What (said he, and kissed me) brings\n",
      "you this way? I hope to meet me.--Yes, sir, said I. That's kind, indeed,\n",
      "said he; but why that averted eye?--that downcast countenance, as if you\n",
      "was afraid of me? You must not think so, sir, said I. Revive my heart\n",
      "then, said he, with a more cheerful aspect; and let that over-anxious\n",
      "solicitude, which appears in the most charming face in the world, be\n",
      "chased from it.--Have you, my dear girl any fears that I can dissipate;\n",
      "any doubts that I can obviate; any hopes that I can encourage; any\n",
      "request that I can gratify?--Speak, my dear Pamela; and if I have power,\n",
      "but speak, and to purchase one smile, it shall be done!\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot, sir, said I, have any fears, any doubts, but that I shall\n",
      "never be able to deserve all your goodness. I have no hopes, but that\n",
      "my future conduct may be agreeable to you, and my determined duty well\n",
      "accepted. Nor have I any request to make, but that you will forgive all\n",
      "my imperfections and, among the rest, this foolish weakness, that makes\n",
      "me seem to you, after all the generous things that have passed, to want\n",
      "this further condescension, and these kind assurances. But indeed, sir,\n",
      "I am oppressed by your bounty; my spirits sink under the weight of it;\n",
      "and the oppression is still the greater, as I see not how, possibly,\n",
      "in my whole future life, by all I can do, to merit the least of your\n",
      "favours.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know your grateful heart, said he; but remember, my dear, what the\n",
      "lawyers tell us, That marriage is the highest consideration which the\n",
      "law knows. And this, my sweet bride, has made you mine, and me yours;\n",
      "and you have the best claim in the world to share my fortune with me.\n",
      "But, set that consideration aside, what is the obligation you have to\n",
      "me? Your mind is pure as that of an angel, and as much transcends mine.\n",
      "Your wit, and your judgment, to make you no compliment, are more than\n",
      "equal to mine: You have all the graces that education can give a woman,\n",
      "improved by a genius which makes those graces natural to you. You have\n",
      "a sweetness of temper, and a noble sincerity, beyond all comparison; and\n",
      "in the beauty of your person, you excel all the ladies I ever saw. Where\n",
      "then, my dearest, is the obligation, if not on my side to you?--But, to\n",
      "avoid these comparisons, let us talk of nothing henceforth but equality;\n",
      "although, if the riches of your mind, and your unblemished virtue, be\n",
      "set against my fortune, (which is but an accidental good, as I may call\n",
      "it, and all I have to boast of,) the condescension will be yours; and\n",
      "I shall not think I can possibly deserve you, till, after your sweet\n",
      "example, my future life shall become nearly as blameless as yours.\n",
      "\n",
      "O, sir, said I, what comfort do you give me, that, instead of my being\n",
      "in danger of being ensnared by the high condition to which your goodness\n",
      "has exalted me, you make me hope, that I shall be confirmed and approved\n",
      "by you; and that we may have a prospect of perpetuating each other's\n",
      "happiness, till time shall be no more!--But, sir, I will not, as you\n",
      "once cautioned me, be too serious. I will resolve, with these sweet\n",
      "encouragements, to be, in every thing, what you would have me be: And I\n",
      "hope I shall, more and more, shew you that I have no will but yours. He\n",
      "kissed me very tenderly, and thanked me for this kind assurance, as he\n",
      "called it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so we entered the house together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Eight o'clock at night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now these sweet assurances, my dear father and mother, you will say,\n",
      "must be very consolatory to me; and being voluntary on his side, were\n",
      "all that could be wished for on mine; and I was resolved, if possible,\n",
      "to subdue my idle fears and apprehensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten o'clock at night.\n",

      "delicate manner, how my colour went and came, and how foolishly I\n",

      "as a compliment on your nuptials. Give Colbrand ten guineas give: the\n",
      "two coachmen five guineas each; to the two maids at this house five\n",
      "guineas each; give Abraham five guineas; give Thomas five guineas; and\n",
      "give the gardeners, grooms, and helpers, twenty guineas among them. And\n",
      "when, said he, I return with you to the other house, I will make you a\n",
      "suitable present, to buy you such ornaments as are fit for my beloved\n",
      "wife to appear in. For now, my Pamela, continued he, you are not to\n",
      "mind, as you once proposed, what other ladies will say; but to appear as\n",
      "my wife ought to do. Else it would look as if what you thought of, as\n",
      "a means to avoid the envy of others of your sex, was a wilful slight\n",
      "in me, which, I hope, I never shall be guilty of; and I will shew the\n",
      "world, that I value you as I ought, and as if I had married the first\n",
      "fortune in the kingdom: And why should it not be so, when I know none of\n",
      "the first quality that matches you in excellence?\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw I was at a loss for words, and said, I see, my dearest bride! my\n",
      "spouse! my wife! my Pamela! your grateful confusion. And kissing me, as\n",
      "I was going to speak, I will stop your dear mouth, said he: You shall\n",
      "not so much as thank me; for when I have done ten times more than this,\n",
      "I shall but poorly express my love for so much beauty of mind, and\n",
      "loveliness of person; which thus, said he, and clasped me to his\n",
      "generous bosom, I can proudly now call my own!--O how, my dear parents,\n",
      "can I think of any thing, but redoubled love, joy, and gratitude!\n",
      "\n",
      "And thus generously did he banish from my mind those painful\n",
      "reflections, and bashful apprehensions, that made me dread to see\n",
      "him for the first time this day, when I was called to attend him at\n",
      "breakfast; and made me all ease, composure, and tranquillity.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then, thinking I seemed somewhat thoughtful, proposed a little turn\n",
      "in the chariot till dinner-time: And this was another sweet relief\n",
      "to me; and he diverted me with twenty agreeable relations, of what\n",
      "observations he had made in his travels; and gave me the characters of\n",
      "the ladies and gentlemen in his other neighbourhood; telling me whose\n",
      "acquaintance he would have me most cultivate. And when I mentioned Lady\n",
      "Davers with apprehension, he said, To be sure I love my sister dearly,\n",
      "notwithstanding her violent spirit; and I know she loves me; and I can\n",
      "allow a little for her pride, because I know what my own so lately was;\n",
      "and because she knows not my Pamela, and her excellencies, as I do.\n",
      "But you must not, my dear, forget what belongs to your character, as\n",
      "my wife, nor meanly stoop to her; though I know you will choose, by\n",
      "softness, to try to move her to a proper behaviour. But it shall be my\n",
      "part to see, that you do not yield too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, continued he, as I would not publicly declare my marriage here,\n",
      "I hope she won't come near us till we are in Bedfordshire; and then,\n",
      "when she knows we are married, she will keep away, if she is not willing\n",
      "to be reconciled; for she dares not, surely, come to quarrel with me,\n",
      "when she knows it is done; for that would have a hateful and wicked\n",
      "appearance, as if she would try to make differences between man and\n",
      "wife.--But we will have no more of this subject, nor talk of any thing,\n",
      "added he, that shall give concern to my dearest. And so he changed the\n",
      "talk to a more pleasing subject, and said the kindest and most soothing\n",
      "things in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we came home, which was about dinner-time, he was the same\n",
      "obliging, kind gentleman; and, in short, is studious to shew, on every\n",
      "occasion, his generous affection to me. And, after dinner, he told\n",
      "me, he had already written to his draper, in town, to provide him new\n",
      "liveries; and to his late mother's mercer, to send him down patterns of\n",
      "the most fashionable silks, for my choice. I told him, I was unable to\n",
      "express my gratitude for his favours and generosity: And as he knew best\n",
      "what befitted his own rank and condition, I would wholly remit myself\n",
      "to his good pleasure. But, by all his repeated bounties to me, of so\n",
      "extraordinary a nature, I could not but look forward with awe upon the\n",
      "condition to which he had exalted me; and now I feared I should hardly\n",
      "be able to act up to it in such a manner as should justify the choice he\n",
      "had condescended to make: But that, I hoped, I should have not only his\n",
      "generous allowance for my imperfections, which I could only assure him\n",
      "should not be wilful ones, but his kind instructions; and that as often\n",
      "as he observed any part of my conduct such as he could not entirely\n",
      "approve, he would let me know it; and I would think his reproofs of\n",
      "beginning faults the kindest and most affectionate things in the world\n",
      "because they would keep me from committing greater; and be a means to\n",
      "continue to me the blessing of his good opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "He answered me in the kindest manner; and assured me, That nothing\n",
      "should ever lie upon his mind which he would not reveal, and give me an\n",
      "opportunity either of convincing him, or being convinced myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then asked me, When I should be willing to go to the Bedfordshire\n",
      "house? I said, whenever he pleased. We will come down hither again\n",
      "before the winter, said he, if you please, in order to cultivate the\n",
      "acquaintance you have begun with Lady Jones, and Sir Simon's family;\n",
      "and, if it please God to spare us to one another, in the winter I will\n",
      "give you, as I promised for two or three months, the diversions of\n",
      "London. And I think, added he, if my dear pleases, we will set out next\n",
      "week, about Tuesday, for t'other house. I can have no objection, sir,\n",
      "said I, to any thing you propose; but how will you avoid Miss Darnford's\n",
      "solicitation for an evening to dance? Why, said he, we can make Monday\n",
      "evening do for that purpose, if they won't excuse us. But, if you\n",
      "please, said he, I will invite Lady Jones, Mr. Peters and his family,\n",
      "and Sir Simon and his family, to my little chapel, on Sunday morning,\n",
      "and to stay dinner with me; and then I will declare my marriage to them,\n",
      "because my dear life shall not leave this country with the least reason\n",
      "for a possibility of any body's doubting that it is so. O! how good\n",
      "was this! But, indeed, his conduct is all of a piece, noble, kind, and\n",
      "considerate! What a happy creature am I!--And then, may be, said he,\n",
      "they will excuse us till we return into this country again, as to the\n",
      "ball. Is there any thing, added he, that my beloved Pamela has still to\n",
      "wish? If you have, freely speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hitherto, my dearest sir, replied I, you have not only prevented my\n",
      "wishes, but my hopes, and even my thoughts. And yet I must own, since\n",
      "your kind command of speaking my mind seems to shew, that you expect\n",
      "from me I should say something; that I have only one or two things to\n",
      "wish more, and then I shall be too happy. Say, said he, what they are.\n",
      "Sir, proceeded I, I am, indeed, ashamed to ask any thing, lest it should\n",
      "not be agreeable to you; and lest it should look as if I was taking\n",
      "advantage of your kind condescensions to me, and knew not when to be\n",
      "satisfied!\n",
      "\n",
      "I will only tell you, Pamela, said he, that you are not to imagine,\n",
      "that these things, which I have done, in hopes of obliging you, are the\n",
      "sudden impulses of a new passion for you. But, if I can answer for my\n",
      "own mind, they proceed from a regular and uniform desire of obliging\n",
      "you: which, I hope, will last as long as your merit lasts; and that, I\n",
      "make no doubt, will be as long as I live. And I can the rather answer\n",
      "for this, because I really find so much delight in myself in my present\n",
      "way of thinking and acting, as infinitely overpays me; and which, for\n",
      "that reason, I am likely to continue, for both our sakes. My beloved\n",
      "wife, therefore, said he, for methinks I am grown fond of a name I once\n",
      "despised, may venture to speak her mind; and I will promise, that, so\n",
      "far as it is agreeable to me, and I cheerfully can, I will comply; and\n",
      "you will not insist upon it, if that should not be the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, sir, said I, I ought not, neither will I. And now you\n",
      "embolden me to become an humble petitioner, and that, as I ought, upon\n",
      "my knees, for the reinstating such of your servants, as I have been the\n",
      "unhappy occasion of their disobliging you. He raised me up, and said,\n",
      "My beloved Pamela has too often been in this suppliant posture to me,\n",
      "to permit it any more. Rise, my fairest, and let me know whom, in\n",
      "particular, you would reinstate; and he kindly held me in his arms, and\n",
      "pressed me to his beloved bosom. Mrs. Jervis, sir, said I, in the first\n",
      "place; for she is a good woman; and the misfortunes she has had in the\n",
      "world, must make your displeasure most heavy to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said he, who next? Mr. Longman, sir, said I; and I am sure, kind\n",
      "as they have been to me, yet would I not ask it, if I could not vouch\n",
      "for their integrity, and if I did not think it was my dear master's\n",
      "interest to have such good servants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you any thing further? said he.--Sir, said I, your good old butler,\n",
      "who has so long been in your family before the day of your happy birth,\n",
      "I would, if I might, become an advocate for!\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said he, I have only to say, That had not Mr. Longman and Mrs.\n",
      "Jervis, and Jonathan too, joined in a body, in a bold appeal to Lady\n",
      "Davers, which has given her the insolent handle she has taken to\n",
      "intermeddle in my affairs, I could easily have forgiven all the rest of\n",
      "their conduct; though they have given their tongues no little license\n",
      "about me: But I could have forgiven them, because I desire every body\n",
      "should admire you; and it is with pride that I observe not only their\n",
      "opinion and love, but that of every body else that knows you, justify my\n",
      "own.--But yet, I will forgive even this, because my Pamela desires it;\n",
      "and I will send a letter myself, to tell Longman what he owes to your\n",
      "interposition, if the estate he has made in my family does not set him\n",
      "above the acceptance of it. And, as to Mrs. Jervis, do you, my dear,\n",
      "write a letter to her, and give her your commands, instantly, on, the\n",
      "receipt of it, to go and take possession of her former charge; for now,\n",
      "my dearest girl, she will be more immediately your servant; and I know\n",
      "you love her so well, that you'll go thither with the more pleasure to\n",
      "find her there.--But don't think, added he, that all this compliance is\n",
      "to be for nothing. Ah, sir! said I, tell me but what I can do, poor as\n",
      "I am in power, but rich in will; and I will not hesitate one moment. Why\n",
      "then, said he, of your own accord, reward me for my cheerful compliance,\n",
      "with one sweet kiss--I instantly said, Thus, then, dear sir, will I\n",
      "obey; and, oh! you have the sweetest and most generous way in the world,\n",
      "to make that a condition, which gives me double honour, and adds to\n",
      "my obligations. And so I clasped my arms about his neck, and was not\n",
      "ashamed to kiss him once and twice, and three times; once for every\n",
      "forgiven person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, my dearest Pamela, said he, what other things have you to ask? Mr.\n",
      "Williams is already taken care of; and, I hope, will be happy.--Have you\n",
      "nothing to say for John Arnold?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, dear sir, said I, you have seen the poor fellow's penitence in my\n",
      "letters.--Yes, my dear, so I have; but that is his penitence for his\n",
      "having served me against you; and, I think, when he would have betrayed\n",
      "me afterwards, he deserves nothing to be said or done for him by either.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, dear sir, said I, this is a day of jubilee; and the less he\n",
      "deserves, poor fellow, the more will be your goodness. And let me add\n",
      "one word; That as he was divided in his inclinations between his duty to\n",
      "you and good wishes to me, and knew not how to distinguish between the\n",
      "one and the other, when he finds us so happily united by your great\n",
      "goodness to me, he will have no more puzzles in his duty; for he has not\n",
      "failed in any other part of it; but, I hope, will serve you faithfully\n",
      "for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, then, suppose I put Mrs. Jewkes in a good way of business, in some\n",
      "inn, and give her John for a husband? And then your gipsy story will be\n",
      "made out, that she will have a husband younger than herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are all goodness, sir, said I. I can freely forgive poor Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes, and wish her happy. But permit me, sir, to ask, Would not this\n",
      "look like a very heavy punishment to poor John? and as if you could not\n",
      "forgive him, when you are so generous to every body else?\n",
      "\n",
      "He smiled and said, O my Pamela, this, for a forgiving spirit, is very\n",
      "severe upon poor Jewkes: But I shall never, by the grace of God, have\n",
      "any more such trying services, to put him or the rest upon; and if you\n",
      "can forgive him, I think I may: and so John shall be at your disposal.\n",
      "And now let me know what my Pamela has further to wish?\n",
      "\n",
      "O, my dearest sir, said I, not a single wish more has your grateful\n",
      "Pamela! My heart is overwhelmed with your goodness! Forgive these tears\n",
      "of joy, added I: You have left me nothing to pray for, but that God\n",
      "will bless you with life, and health, and honour, and continue to me the\n",
      "blessing of your esteem; and I shall then be the happiest creature in\n",
      "the world.\n",

      "untenanted, upon that estate, and tolerably well stocked, and I will\n",
      "further stock it for them; for such industrious folks won't know how\n",
      "to live without some employment; And it shall be theirs for both their\n",
      "lives, without paying any rent; and I will allow them 50l. per annum\n",
      "besides, that they may keep up the stock, and be kind to any other of\n",
      "their relations, without being beholden to you or me for small matters;\n",
      "and for greater, where needful, you shall always have it in your power\n",
      "to accommodate them; for I shall never question your prudence. And we\n",

      "overwhelmed with his goodness!\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said he, my dearest, let me desire you to mention this to them, to\n",
      "see if they approve it. But, if it be your choice, and theirs, to have\n",
      "them nearer to you, or even under the same roof with you, I will freely\n",
      "consent to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "O no, sir, said I, (and I fear almost sinned in my grateful flight,) I\n",
      "am sure they would not choose that; they could not, perhaps, serve God\n",
      "so well if they were to live with you: For, so constantly seeing the\n",
      "hand that blesses them, they would, it may be, as must be my care to\n",
      "avoid, be tempted to look no further in their gratitude, than to the\n",
      "dear dispenser of such innumerable benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent creature! said he: My beloved wants no language, nor\n",
      "sentiments neither; and her charming thoughts, so sweetly expressed,\n",
      "would grace any language; and this is a blessing almost peculiar to\n",
      "my fairest.--Your so kind acceptance, my Pamela, added he, repays the\n",
      "benefit with interest, and leaves me under obligation to your goodness.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now, my dearest, I will tell you what we will do, with regard to\n",
      "points of your own private charity; for far be it from me, to put under\n",
      "that name the subject we have been mentioning; because that, and more\n",
      "than that, is duty to persons so worthy, and so nearly related to my\n",
      "Pamela, and, as such, to myself.--O how the sweet man outdoes me, in\n",
      "thoughts, words, power, and every thing!\n",
      "\n",
      "And this, said he, lies in very small compass; for I will allow you two\n",
      "hundred pounds a year, which Longman shall constantly pay you, at fifty\n",
      "pounds a quarter, for your own use, and of which I expect no account;\n",
      "to commence from the day you enter into my other house: I mean, said he,\n",
      "that the first fifty pounds shall then be due; because you shall have\n",
      "something to begin with. And, added the dear generous man, if this be\n",
      "pleasing to you, let it, since you say you want words, be signified by\n",
      "such a sweet kiss as you gave me yesterday. I hesitated not a moment to\n",
      "comply with these obliging terms, and threw my arms about his dear neck,\n",
      "though in the chariot, and blessed his goodness to me. But, indeed, sir,\n",
      "said I, I cannot bear this generous treatment! He was pleased to say,\n",
      "Don't be uneasy, my dear, about these trifles: God has blessed me with a\n",
      "very good estate, and all of it in a prosperous condition, and generally\n",
      "well tenanted. I lay up money every year, and have, besides, large sums\n",
      "in government and other securities; so that you will find, what I have\n",
      "hitherto promised, is very short of that proportion of my substance,\n",
      "which, as my dearest wife, you have a right to.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this sweet manner did we pass our time till evening, when the chariot\n",
      "brought us home; and then our supper succeeded in the same agreeable\n",
      "manner. And thus, in a rapturous circle, the time moves on; every hour\n",
      "bringing with it something more delightful than the past!--Sure nobody\n",
      "was ever so blest as I!\n",

      "Not going to chapel this morning, the reason of which I told you, I\n",
      "bestowed the time, from the hour of my beloved's rising, to breakfast,\n",
      "in prayer and thanksgiving, in my closet; and now I begin to be quite\n",
      "easy, cheerful, and free in my spirits; and the rather, as I find myself\n",
      "encouraged by the tranquillity, and pleasing vivacity, in the temper\n",
      "and behaviour of my beloved, who thereby shews he does not repent of his\n",
      "goodness to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I attended him to breakfast with great pleasure and freedom, and he\n",

      "look upon me with an air of serenity and satisfaction: it shall be\n",
      "always, added he, my delight to give you occasion for this sweet\n",
      "becoming aspect of confidence and pleasure in me.--My heart, dear sir,\n",
      "said I, is quite easy, and has lost all its foolish tumults, which,\n",
      "combating with my gratitude, might give an unacceptable appearance to my\n",
      "behaviour: but now your goodness, sir, has enabled it to get the better\n",
      "of its uneasy apprehensions, and my heart is all of one piece, and\n",
      "devoted to you, and grateful tranquillity. And could I be so happy as to\n",
      "see you and my good Lady Davers reconciled, I have nothing in this world\n",
      "to wish for more, but the continuance of your favour. He said, I wish\n",
      "this reconciliation, my dearest, as well as you: and I do assure you,\n",
      "more for your sake than my own; and if she would behave tolerably, I\n",
      "would make the terms easier to her, for that reason.\n",

      "we can, we shall have our visitors conform to them too, and expect them\n",
      "from us, and suit themselves accordingly: For I have always observed,\n",
      "that it is in every one's power to prescribe rules to himself. It is\n",
      "only standing a few ridiculous jests at first, and that too from such,\n",
      "generally, as are not the most worthy to be minded; and, after a while,\n",

      "when they see plenty and variety at my board, and meet a kind and\n",
      "hearty welcome from us both; they will not offer to break in upon my\n",
      "conditions, nor grudge me my regular hours: And as most of these people\n",
      "have nothing to do, except to rise in a morning, they may as well come\n",
      "to breakfast with us at half an hour after eight, in summer, as at ten\n",
      "or eleven; to dinner at two, as at four, five, or six; and to supper\n",
      "at eight, as at ten or eleven. And then our servants, too, will know,\n",
      "generally, the times of their business, and the hours of their leisure\n",
      "or recess; and we, as well as they, shall reap the benefits of\n",
      "this regularity. And who knows, my dear, but we may revive the good\n",

      "school, Every one mend one. And the worst that will happen will be, that\n",
      "when some of my brother rakes, such as those who broke in upon us, so\n",
      "unwelcomely, last Thursday, are got out of the way, if that can ever be,\n",
      "and begin to consider who they shall go to dine with in their rambles,\n",

      "you won't think them unreasonable, I shall be glad they may, as often as\n",

      "mistrust yourself, and apply to your glass; and if you see a gloom\n",
      "arising, or arisen, banish it instantly; smooth your dear countenance;\n",
      "resume your former composure; and then, my dearest, whose heart must\n",
      "always be seen in her face, and cannot be a hypocrite, will find this a\n",
      "means to smooth her passions also: And if the occasion be too strong for\n",
      "so sudden a conquest, she will know how to do it more effectually, by\n",
      "repairing to her closet, and begging that gracious assistance, which has\n",
      "never yet failed her: And so shall I, my dear, who, as you once but too\n",
      "justly observed, have been too much indulged by my good mother, have\n",

      "the family order laid down by the lady; and especially if any of us\n",
      "have lain under the suspicion of having occasionally seduced our married\n",
      "companion into bad hours, or given indifferent examples, the poor\n",
      "gentleman has been oddly affected at our coming; though the good\n",
      "breeding of the lady has made her just keep up appearances. He has\n",
      "looked so conscious; has been so afraid, as it were, to disoblige; has\n",
      "made so many excuses for some of us, before we had been accused, as have\n",
      "always shewn me how unwelcome we have been; and how much he is obliged\n",
      "to compound with his lady for a tolerable reception of us; and, perhaps,\n",
      "she too, in proportion to the honest man's concern to court her smiles,\n",
      "has been more reserved, stiff, and formal; and has behaved with an\n",
      "indifference and slight that has often made me wish myself out of her\n",
      "house; for too plainly have I seen that it was not his.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, my dear, you will judge, by my description, has afforded me\n",
      "subject for animadversion upon the married life; for a man may not\n",
      "(though, in the main, he is willing to flatter himself that he is master\n",
      "of his house, and will assert his prerogative upon great occasions, when\n",
      "it is strongly invaded) be always willing to contend; and such women\n",
      "as those I have described, are always ready to take the field, and are\n",
      "worse enemies than the old Parthians, who annoy most when they seem to\n",
      "retreat; and never fail to return to the charge again, and carry on the\n",
      "offensive war, till they have tired out resistance, and made the husband\n",
      "willing, like a vanquished enemy, to compound for small matters, in\n",
      "order to preserve something. At least the poor man does not care to let\n",

      "You smile, my Pamela, said he, at this whimsical picture; and, I am\n",
      "sure, I never shall have reason to include you in these disagreeable\n",
      "outlines; but yet I will say, that I expect from you, whoever comes to\n",
      "my house, that you accustom yourself to one even, uniform complaisance:\n",
      "That no frown take place on your brow: That however ill or well provided\n",
      "we may be for their reception, you shew no flutter or discomposure: That\n",
      "whoever you may have in your company at the time, you signify not,\n",
      "by the least reserved look, that the stranger is come upon you\n",
      "unseasonably, or at a time you wished he had not. But be facetious,\n",
      "kind, obliging to all; and, if to one more than another, to such as have\n",
      "the least reason to expect it from you, or who are most inferior at the\n",
      "table; for thus will you, my Pamela, cheer the doubting mind, quiet the\n",
      "uneasy heart, and diffuse ease, pleasure, and tranquillity, around my\n",
      "board.\n",
      "\n",
      "And be sure, my dear, continued he, let no little accidents ruffle your\n",
      "temper. I shall never forget once that I was at Lady Arthur's; and a\n",
      "footman happened to stumble, and let fall a fine china dish, and broke\n",
      "it all to pieces: It was grievous to see the uneasiness it gave the poor\n",
      "lady: And she was so sincere in it, that she suffered it to spread all\n",
      "over the company; and it was a pretty large one too; and not a person\n",
      "in it but turned either her consoler, or fell into stories of the like\n",
      "misfortunes; and so we all became, for the rest of the evening, nothing\n",
      "but blundering footmen, and careless servants, or were turned\n",
      "into broken jars, plates, glasses, tea-cups, and such like brittle\n",
      "substances. And it affected me so much, that, when I came home, I went\n",
      "to bed, and dreamt, that Robin, with the handle of his whip, broke the\n",
      "fore glass of my chariot; and I was so solicitous, methought, to keep\n",
      "the good lady in countenance for her anger, that I broke his head in\n",
      "revenge, and stabbed one of my coach-horses. And all the comfort I had\n",
      "when it was done, methought, was, that I had not exposed myself before\n",
      "company; and there were no sufferers, but guilty Robin, and one innocent\n",
      "coach-horse.\n",

      "I was exceedingly diverted with the facetious hints, and the pleasant\n",
      "manner in which he gave them; and I promised to improve by the excellent\n",
      "lessons contained in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then went up and dressed myself, as like a bride as I could, in my\n",
      "best clothes; and, on inquiry, hearing my dearest master was gone to\n",
      "walk in the garden, I went to find him out. He was reading in the little\n",
      "alcove; and I said, Sir, am I licensed to intrude upon you?--No, my\n",
      "dear, said he, because you cannot intrude. I am so wholly yours, that,\n",
      "wherever I am, you have not only a right to join me, but you do me a\n",
      "very acceptable favour at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have, sir, said I, obeyed your first kind injunction, as to dressing\n",
      "myself before dinner; but may be you are busy, sir. He put up the papers\n",
      "he was reading, and said, I can have no business or pleasure of equal\n",
      "value to your company, my dear. What were you going to say?--Only, sir,\n",
      "to know if you have any more kind injunctions to give me?--I could hear\n",
      "you talk a whole day together.--You are very obliging, Pamela, said he;\n",
      "but you are so perfectly what I wish, that I might have spared those I\n",
      "gave you; but I was willing you should have a taste of my freedom with\n",
      "you, to put you upon the like with me: For I am confident there can be\n",
      "no friendship lasting, without freedom, and without communicating to one\n",
      "another even the little caprices, if my Pamela can have any such, which\n",
      "may occasion uneasiness to either.\n",
      "\n",

      "O sir, said I, and I could have kissed him, but for shame, (To be sure\n",
      "I shall grow a sad fond hussy,) I have not one single thing to wish for;\n",
      "no, not one!--He saluted me very kindly, and said, He should be sorry if\n",
      "I had, and forbore to speak it. Do you think, my dear sir, said I, that\n",
      "your Pamela has no conscience? Do you think, that because you so\n",
      "kindly oblige her, and delight in obliging her, that she must rack\n",
      "her invention for trials of your goodness, and knows not when she's\n",
      "happy?--O my dearest sir, added I, less than one half of the favours\n",
      "you have so generously conferred upon me, would have exceeded my utmost\n",
      "wishes!\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear angel, said he, and kissed me again, I shall be troublesome\n",
      "to you with my kisses, if you continue thus sweetly obliging in your\n",
      "actions and expressions. O sir, said I, I have been thinking, as I was\n",
      "dressing myself, what excellent lessons you teach me!\n",
      "\n",
      "When you commanded me, at your table to cheer the doubting mind and\n",
      "comfort the uneasy heart, and to behave most kindly to those who have\n",
      "least reason to expect it, and are most inferior; how sweetly, in every\n",
      "instance that could possibly occur, have you done this yourself by your\n",

      "Then again, sir, when you bid me not be disturbed by little accidents,\n",
      "or by strangers coming in upon me unexpectedly, how noble an instance\n",
      "did you give me of this, when, on our happy wedding-day, the coming of\n",
      "Sir Charles Hargrave, and the other two gentlemen, (for which you were\n",
      "quite unprovided, and which hindered our happiness of dining together on\n",
      "that chosen day,) did not so disturb you, but that you entertained the\n",
      "gentlemen pleasantly, and parted with them civilly and kindly! What\n",
      "charming instances are these, I have been recollecting with pleasure, of\n",
      "your pursuing the doctrine you deliver.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear, said he, these observations are very kind in you, and much to\n",
      "my advantage: But if I do not always (for I fear these were too much\n",
      "accidents) so well pursue the doctrines I lay down, my Pamela must not\n",
      "expect that my imperfections will be a plea for her nonobservance of my\n",
      "lessons, as you call them; for, I doubt I shall never be half so perfect\n",
      "as you; and so I cannot permit you to recede in your goodness, though I\n",
      "may find myself unable to advance as I ought in my duty.\n",

      "lose it; and yet, my beloved Pamela, I shall think nothing but that loss\n",
      "wanting, to complete my happiness.--I put my bold hand before his mouth,\n",
      "and said, Hush, hush! O fie, sir!--The freest thing you have ever yet\n",
      "said, since I have been yours!--He kissed my hand, and said, Such an\n",
      "innocent wish, my dearest, may be permitted me, because it is the end\n",
      "of the institution.--But say, Would such a case be unwelcome to my\n",
      "Pamela?--I will say, sir, said I, and hid my blushing face on his bosom,\n",

      "to the pond, and kneeled down on the mossy bank, and again blessed God\n",
      "there, for his mercy in my escape from myself, my then worst enemy,\n",
      "though I thought I had none but enemies, and no friend near me. And so I\n",
      "ought to do in almost every step of this garden, and every room in this\n",

      "ladies: And he said, That's well thought of; bring it, Mrs. Jewkes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And she came, with Nan attending her, with two bottles and glasses, and\n",
      "a salver; and must needs, making a low courtesy, offered first to me;\n",
      "saying, Will your ladyship begin? I coloured like scarlet, and said,\n",
      "No;--my master, to be sure!\n",
      "\n",
      "But they all took the hint; and Miss Darnford said, I'll be hanged if\n",
      "they have not stolen a wedding! said Mrs. Peters, It must certainly be\n",
      "so! Ah! Mr. Peters.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll assure you, said he, I have not married them. Where were you, said\n",
      "she, and Mr. Williams, last Thursday morning? said Sir Simon, Let me\n",
      "alone, let me alone; if any thing has been stolen, I'll find it out!\n",
      "I'm a justice of the peace, you know. And so he took me by the hand,\n",
      "and said, Come, madam, answer me, by the oath you have taken: Are you\n",
      "married or not?\n",
      "\n",
      "My master smiled, to see me look so like a fool; and I said, Pray, Sir\n",
      "Simon!--Ay, ay, said he; I thought you did not look so smirking upon\n",
      "us for nothing.--Well, then, Pamela, said my master, since your blushes\n",
      "discover you, don't be ashamed, but confess the truth!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, said Miss Darnford, I am quite angry; and, said Lady Darnford, I am\n",
      "quite pleased; let me give you joy, dear madam, if it be so. And so\n",
      "they all said, and saluted me all round.--I was vexed it was before Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes; for she shook her fat sides, and seemed highly pleased to be a\n",
      "means of discovering it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody, said my master, wishes me joy. No, said Lady Jones, very\n",
      "obligingly, nobody need; for, with such a peerless spouse, you want no\n",
      "good wishes:--And he saluted them; and when he came last to me, said,\n",
      "before them all, Now, my sweet bride, my Pamela, let me conclude with\n",
      "you; for here I began to love, and here I desire to end loving, but not\n",
      "till my life ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was sweetly said, and taken great notice of; and it was doing\n",
      "credit to his own generous choice, and vastly more than I merited.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I was forced to stand many more jokes afterwards: For Sir Simon\n",
      "said, several times, Come, come, madam, now you are become one of us, I\n",
      "shall be a little less scrupulous than I have been, I'll assure you.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we came in to dinner, I made no difficulty of what all offered me,\n",
      "the upper end of the table; and performed the honours of it with pretty\n",
      "tolerable presence of mind, considering. And, with much ado, my good\n",
      "benefactor promising to be down again before winter, we got off the\n",
      "ball; but appointed Tuesday evening, at Lady Darnford's, to take leave\n",
      "of all this good company, who promised to be there, my master designing\n",
      "to set out on Wednesday morning for Bedfordshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had prayers in the little chapel, in the afternoon; but they all\n",
      "wished for the good clerk again, with great encomiums upon you, my dear\n",
      "father; and the company staid supper also, and departed exceeding well\n",
      "satisfied, and with abundance of wishes for the continuance of our\n",
      "mutual happiness; and my master desired Mr. Peters to answer for him to\n",
      "the ringers at the town, if they should hear of it; till our return into\n",
      "this country; and that then he would be bountiful to them, because he\n",
      "would not publicly declare it till he had first done so in Bedfordshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Monday, the fifth day.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have had very little of my dear friend's company this day; for he\n",
      "only staid breakfast with me, and rode out to see a sick gentleman about\n",
      "eighteen miles off, who begged (by a man and horse on purpose) to speak\n",
      "with him, believing he should not recover, and upon part of whose estate\n",
      "my master has a mortgage. He said, My dearest, I shall be very uneasy,\n",
      "if I am obliged to tarry all night from you; but, lest you should be\n",
      "alarmed, if I don't come home by ten, don't expect me: For poor Mr.\n",
      "Carlton and I have pretty large concerns together; and if he should be\n",
      "very ill, and would be comforted by my presence, (as I know he loves me,\n",
      "and his family will be more in my power, if he dies, than I wish for,)\n",
      "charity will not let me refuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is now ten o'clock at night, and I fear he will not return. I fear,\n",
      "for the sake of his poor sick friend, who, I doubt, is worse. Though I\n",
      "know not the gentleman, I am sorry for his own sake, for his family's\n",
      "sake, and for my dear master's sake, who, by his kind expressions, I\n",
      "find, loves him: And, methinks, I should be sorry any grief should touch\n",
      "his generous heart; though yet there is no living in this world, without\n",
      "too many occasions for concern, even in the most prosperous state. And\n",
      "it is fit it should be so; or else, poor wretches, as we are! we should\n",
      "look no farther, but be like sensual travellers on a journey homeward,\n",
      "who, meeting with good entertainment at some inn on the way, put up\n",
      "their rest there, and never think of pursuing their journey to their\n",
      "proper home.--This, I remember, was often a reflection of my good\n",
      "lady's, to whom I owe it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Eleven o'clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes has been with me, and asked if I will have her for a\n",
      "bed-fellow, in want of a better? I thanked her; but I said, I would see\n",
      "how it was to be by myself one night.\n",
      "\n",
      "I might have mentioned, that I made Mrs. Jewkes dine and sup with me;\n",
      "and she was much pleased with it, and my behaviour to her. And I could\n",
      "see, by her manner, that she was a little struck inwardly at some of her\n",
      "former conduct to me. But, poor wretch! it is much, I fear, because I am\n",
      "what I am; for she has otherwise very little remorse I doubt. Her talk\n",
      "and actions are entirely different from what they used to be, quite\n",
      "circumspect and decent; and I should have thought her virtuous, and even\n",
      "pious, had I never known her in another light.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this we may see, my dear father and mother, of what force example is,\n",
      "and what is in the power of the heads of families to do: And this shews,\n",
      "that evil examples, in superiors, are doubly pernicious, and doubly\n",
      "culpable, because such persons are bad themselves, and not only do no\n",
      "good, but much harm to others; and the condemnation of such must, to be\n",
      "sure, be so much the greater!--And how much the greater still must my\n",
      "condemnation be, who have had such a religious education under you,\n",
      "and been so well nurtured by my good lady, if I should forget, with all\n",
      "these mercies heaped upon me, what belongs to the station I am preferred\n",
      "to!--O how I long to be doing some good! For all that is past yet, is\n",
      "my dear, dear master's, God bless him! and return him safe to my wishes!\n",
      "for methinks, already, 'tis a week since I saw him. If my love would not\n",
      "be troublesome and impertinent, I should be nothing else; for I have a\n",
      "true grateful spirit; and I had need to have such a one, for I am poor\n",
      "in every thing but will.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuesday morning, eleven o'clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear, dear--master (I'm sure I should still say; but I will learn to\n",
      "rise to a softer epithet, now-and-then) is not yet come. I hope he is\n",
      "safe and well!--So Mrs. Jewkes and I went to breakfast. But I can do\n",
      "nothing but talk and think of him, and all his kindness to me, and to\n",
      "you, which is still me, more intimately!--I have just received a letter\n",
      "from him, which he wrote overnight, as I find by it, and sent early this\n",
      "morning. This is a copy of it.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "TO MRS. ANDREWS\n",

      "'MY DEAREST PAMELA, Monday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I hope my not coming home this night will not frighten you. You may\n",
      "believe I can't help it. My poor friend is so very ill, that I doubt he\n",
      "can't recover. His desires to have me stay with him are so strong, that\n",
      "I shall sit up all night with him, as it is now near one o'clock in the\n",
      "morning; for he can't bear me out of his sight: And I have made him and\n",
      "his distressed wife and children so easy, in the kindest assurances I\n",
      "could give him of my consideration for him and them, that I am looked\n",
      "upon (as the poor disconsolate widow, as she, I doubt, will soon be,\n",
      "tells me,) as their good angel. I could have wished we had not engaged\n",
      "to the good neighbourhood at Sir Simon's for to-morrow night; but I am\n",
      "so desirous to set out on Wednesday for the other house, that, as well\n",
      "as in return for the civilities of so many good friends, who will be\n",
      "there on purpose, I would not put it off. What I beg of you, therefore,\n",
      "my dear, is, that you would go in the chariot to Sir Simon's, the sooner\n",
      "in the day the better, because you will be diverted with the company,\n",
      "who all so much admire you; and I hope to join you there by your\n",
      "tea-time in the afternoon, which will be better than going home, and\n",
      "returning with you, as it will be six miles difference to me; and I know\n",
      "the good company will excuse my dress, on the occasion. I count every\n",
      "hour of this little absence for a day: for I am, with the utmost\n",
      "sincerity,\n",
      "\n",
      "                                 'My dearest love, for ever yours, etc.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'If you could go to dine with them, it will be a freedom that would be\n",
      "very pleasing to them; and the more, as they don't expect it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I begin to have a little concern, lest his fatigue should be too great,\n",
      "and for the poor sick gentleman and family; but told Mrs. Jewkes, that\n",
      "the least intimation of his choice should be a command to me, and so\n",
      "I would go to dinner there; and ordered the chariot to be got ready to\n",
      "carry me: when a messenger came up, just as I was dressed, to tell her\n",
      "she must come down immediately. I see at the window, that visitors are\n",
      "come; for there is a chariot and six horses, the company gone out of it,\n",
      "and three footmen on horseback; and I think the chariot has coronets.\n",
      "Who can it be, I wonder?--But here I will stop, for I suppose I shall\n",
      "soon know.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good sirs! how unlucky this is! What shall I do!--Here is Lady Davers\n",
      "come, her own self! and my kind protector a great, great many miles\n",
      "off!--Mrs. Jewkes, out of breath, comes and tells me this, and says,\n",
      "she is inquiring for my master and me. She asked her, it seemed, naughty\n",
      "lady as she is, if I was whored yet! There's a word for a lady's mouth!\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes says, she knew not what to answer. And my lady said, She\n",
      "is not married, I hope? And said she, I said, No: because you have not\n",
      "owned it yet publicly. My lady said, That was well enough. Said I, I\n",
      "will run away, Mrs. Jewkes; and let the chariot go to the bottom of\n",
      "the elm-walk, and I will steal out of the door unperceived: But she is\n",
      "inquiring for you, madam, replied she, and I said you was within, but\n",
      "going out; and she said, she would see you presently, as soon as she\n",
      "could have patience. What did she call me? said I. The creature, madam;\n",
      "I will see the creature, said she, as soon as I can have patience. Ay,\n",
      "but, said I, the creature won't let her, if she can help it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pray, Mrs. Jewkes, favour my escape, for this once; for I am sadly\n",
      "frighted.--Said she, I'll bid the chariot go down, as you order, and\n",
      "wait till you come; and I'll step down and shut the hall door, that you\n",
      "may pass unobserved; for she sits cooling herself in the parlour, over\n",
      "against the staircase. That's a good Mrs. Jewkes! said I: But who has\n",
      "she with her? Her woman, answered she, and her nephew; but he came\n",
      "on horseback, and is going into the stables; and they have three\n",
      "footmen.--And I wish, said I, they were all three hundred miles\n",
      "off!--What shall I do?--So I wrote thus far, and wait impatiently to\n",
      "hear the coast is clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes tells me I must come down, or she will come up. What does\n",
      "she call me now? said I. Wench, madam, Bid the wench come down to me.\n",
      "And her nephew and her woman are with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said I, I can't go, and that's enough!--You might contrive it that I\n",
      "might get out, if you would.--Indeed, madam, said she, I cannot; for I\n",
      "went to shut the door, and she bid me let it stand open; and there\n",
      "she sits over against the staircase. Then, said I, I'll get out of the\n",
      "window, I think!--(And fanned myself;) for I am sadly frightened. Laud,\n",
      "madam, said she, I wonder you so much disturb yourself!--You're on the\n",
      "right side the hedge, I'm sure; and I would not be so discomposed for\n",
      "any body. Ay, said I, but who can help constitution? I dare say you\n",
      "would no more be so discomposed, that I can help it.--Said she, Indeed,\n",
      "madam, if it was to me, I would put on an air as mistress of the house,\n",
      "as you are, and go and salute her ladyship, and bid her welcome. Ay, ay,\n",
      "replied I, fine talking!--But how unlucky this is, your good master is\n",
      "not at home!\n",
      "\n",
      "What answer shall I give her, said she, to her desiring to see\n",
      "you?--Tell her, said I, I am sick a-bed; I'm dying, and must not be\n",
      "disturbed; I'm gone out--or any thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "But her woman came up to me just as I had uttered this, and said, How\n",
      "do you do, Mrs. Pamela? My lady desires to speak to you. So I must\n",
      "go.--Sure she won't beat me!--Oh that my dear protector was at home!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, now I will tell you all that happened in this frightful\n",
      "interview.--And very bad it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I went down, dressed as I was, and my gloves on, and my fan in my hand,\n",
      "to be just ready to step into the chariot, when I could get away; and I\n",
      "thought all my trembling fits had been over now; but I was mistaken; for\n",
      "I trembled sadly. Yet resolved to put on as good an air as I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I went to the parlour, and said, making a very low courtesy, Your\n",
      "servant, my good lady! And your servant again, said she, my lady, for I\n",
      "think you are dressed out like one.\n",
      "\n",
      "A charming girl, though! said her rakish nephew, and swore a great oath:\n",
      "Dear aunt, forgive me, but I must kiss her; and was coming to me. And I\n",
      "said, Forbear, uncivil gentleman! I won't be used freely. Jackey, said\n",
      "my lady, sit down, and don't touch the creature--She's proud enough\n",
      "already. There's a great difference in her air, I'll assure you, since I\n",
      "saw her last.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, child, said she, sneeringly, how dost find thyself? Thou'rt\n",
      "mightily come on, of late!--I hear strange reports about thee!--Thou'rt\n",
      "almost got into fool's paradise, I doubt!--And wilt find thyself\n",
      "terribly mistaken in a little while, if thou thinkest my brother will\n",
      "disgrace his family, to humour thy baby-face!\n",
      "\n",
      "I see, said I, sadly vexed, (her woman and nephew smiling by,) your\n",
      "ladyship has no very important commands for me; and I beg leave to\n",
      "withdraw. Beck, said she to her woman, shut the door, my young lady and\n",
      "I must not have done so soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where's your well-mannered deceiver gone, child?--says she.--Said I,\n",
      "When your ladyship is pleased to speak intelligibly, I shall know how to\n",
      "answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, but my dear child, said she, in drollery, don't be too pert\n",
      "neither, I beseech thee. Thou wilt not find thy master's sister half so\n",
      "ready to take thy freedoms, as thy mannerly master is!--So, a little of\n",
      "that modesty and humility that my mother's waiting-maid used to shew,\n",
      "will become thee better than the airs thou givest thyself, since my\n",
      "mother's son has taught thee to forget thyself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would beg, said I, one favour of your ladyship, That if you would have\n",
      "me keep my distance, you will not forget your own degree.--Why, suppose,\n",
      "Miss Pert, I should forget my degree, wouldst thou not keep thy distance\n",
      "then?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you, madam, said I, lessen the distance yourself, you will descend to\n",
      "my level, and make an equality, which I don't presume to think of; for I\n",
      "can't descend lower than I am--at least in your ladyship's esteem!\n",
      "\n",
      "Did I not tell you, Jackey, said she, that I should have a wit to talk\n",
      "to?--He, who swears like a fine gentleman at every word, rapped out an\n",
      "oath, and said, drolling, I think, Mrs. Pamela, if I may be so bold as\n",
      "to say so, you should know you are speaking to Lady Davers!--Sir, said\n",
      "I, I hope there was no need of your information, and so I can't thank\n",
      "you for it; and am sorry you seem to think it wants an oath to convince\n",
      "me of the truth of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked more foolish than I, at this, if possible, not expecting such\n",
      "a reprimand.--And said, at last, Why, Mrs. Pamela, you put me half out\n",
      "of countenance with your witty reproof!--Sir, said I, you seem quite a\n",
      "fine gentleman; and it will not be easily done, I dare say.\n",
      "\n",
      "How now, pert one, said my lady, do you know whom you talk to?--I think\n",
      "I do not, madam, replied I: and for fear I should forget myself more,\n",
      "I'll withdraw. Your ladyship's servant, said I; and was going: but she\n",
      "rose, and gave me a push, and pulled a chair, and, setting the back\n",
      "against the door, sat down in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said I, I can bear anything at your ladyship's hands; but I was\n",
      "ready to cry though. And I went, and sat down, and fanned myself, at the\n",
      "other end of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her woman, who stood all the time, said softly, Mrs. Pamela, you should\n",
      "not sit in my lady's presence. And my lady, though she did not hear her,\n",
      "said, You shall sit down, child, in the room where I am, when I give you\n",
      "leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I stood up, and said, When your ladyship will hardly permit me to\n",
      "stand, one might be indulged to sit down. But I ask you, said she,\n",
      "Whither your master is gone? To one Mr. Carlton, madam, about eighteen\n",
      "miles off, who is very sick. And when does he come home?--This evening,\n",
      "madam. And where are you going? To a gentleman's house in the town,\n",
      "madam.--And how was you to go? In the chariot, madam.--Why, you must\n",
      "be a lady in time, to be sure!--I believe you'd become a chariot mighty\n",
      "well, child!--Was you ever out in it with your master?\n",
      "\n",
      "Pray, your ladyship, said I, a little too pertly, perhaps, be pleased to\n",
      "ask half a dozen such questions together; because one answer may do for\n",
      "all!--Why, bold-face, said she, you'll forget your distance, and bring\n",
      "me to your level before my time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could no longer refrain tears, but said, Pray your ladyship, let me\n",
      "ask what I have done, to be thus severely treated? I never did your\n",
      "ladyship any harm. And if you think I am deceived, as you was pleased to\n",
      "hint, I should be more entitled to your pity, than your anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "She rose, and took me by the hand, and led me to her chair; and then sat\n",
      "down; and still holding my hand, said, Why Pamela, I did indeed pity\n",
      "you while I thought you innocent; and when my brother seized you, and\n",
      "brought you down hither, without your consent, I was concerned for you;\n",
      "and I was still more concerned for you, and loved you, when I heard of\n",
      "your virtue and resistance, and your laudable efforts to get away from\n",
      "him. But when, as I fear, you have suffered yourself to be prevailed\n",
      "upon, and have lost your innocence, and added another to the number\n",
      "of the fools he has ruined, (This shocked me a little,) I cannot help\n",
      "shewing my displeasure to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madam, replied I, I must beg no hasty judgment; I have not lost my\n",
      "innocence.--Take care, take care, Pamela! said she: don't lose your\n",
      "veracity, as well as your honour!--Why are you here, when you are at\n",
      "full liberty to go whither you please?--I will make one proposal to you,\n",
      "and if you are innocent, I am sure you'll accept it. Will you go and\n",
      "live with me?--I will instantly set out with you in my chariot, and not\n",
      "stay half an hour longer in this house, if you'll go with me.--Now, if\n",
      "you are innocent, and willing to keep so, deny me, if you can.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am innocent, madam, replied I, and willing to keep so; and yet I\n",
      "cannot consent to this. Then, said she, very mannerly, Thou liest,\n",
      "child, that's all: and I give thee up!\n",
      "\n",
      "And so she arose, and walked about the room in great wrath. Her nephew\n",
      "and her woman said, Your ladyship's very good; 'tis a plain case; a very\n",
      "plain case!\n",
      "\n",
      "I would have removed the chair, to have gone out; but her nephew came\n",
      "and sat in it. This provoked me; for I thought I should be unworthy of\n",
      "the honour I was raised to, though I was afraid to own it, if I did not\n",
      "shew some spirit; and I said, What, sir, is your pretence in this house,\n",
      "to keep me a prisoner here? Because, said he--I like it.--Do you so,\n",
      "sir? replied I: if that is the answer of a gentleman to such an one\n",
      "as I, it would not, I dare say, be the answer of a gentleman to a\n",
      "gentleman.--My lady! my lady! said he, a challenge, a challenge, by gad!\n",
      "No, sir, said I, I am of a sex that gives no challenges; and you think\n",
      "so too, or you would not give this occasion for the word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said my lady, Don't be surprised, nephew; the wench could not talk thus,\n",
      "if she had not been her master's bed-fellow.--Pamela, Pamela, said she,\n",
      "and tapped me upon the shoulder two or three times, in anger, thou hast\n",
      "lost thy innocence, girl; and thou hast got some of thy bold master's\n",
      "assurance, and art fit to go any where.--Then, and please your ladyship,\n",
      "said I, I am unworthy of your presence, and desire I may quit it.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, replied she, I will know first what reason you can give for not\n",
      "accepting my proposal, if you are innocent? I can give, said I, a very\n",
      "good one: but I beg to be excused. I will hear it, said she. Why, then,\n",
      "answered I, I should perhaps have less reason to like this gentleman,\n",
      "than where I am.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well then, said she, I'll put you to another trial. I'll set out this\n",
      "moment with you to your father and mother, and give you up safe to them.\n",
      "What do you say to that?--Ay, Mrs. Pamela, said her nephew, now what\n",
      "does your innocence say to that?--'Fore gad, madam, you have puzzled her\n",
      "now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be pleased, madam, said I, to call off this fine gentleman. Your\n",
      "kindness in these proposals makes me think you would not have me baited.\n",
      "I'll be d----d, said he, if she does not make me a bull-dog! Why she'll\n",
      "toss us all by and by! Sir, said I, you indeed behave as if you were in\n",
      "a bear-garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jackey, be quiet, said my lady. You only give her a pretence to evade\n",
      "my questions. Come, answer me, Pamela. I will, madam, said I, and it\n",
      "is thus: I have no occasion to be beholden to your ladyship for\n",
      "this honour; for I am to set out to-morrow morning on the way to my\n",
      "parents.--Now again thou liest, wench!--I am not of quality, said I, to\n",
      "answer such language.--Once again, said she, provoke me not, by these\n",
      "reflections, and this pertness; if thou dost, I shall do something by\n",
      "thee unworthy of myself. That, thought I, you have done already; but\n",
      "I ventured not to say so. But who is to carry you, said she, to your\n",
      "father and mother? Who my master pleases, madam, said I. Ay, said she, I\n",
      "doubt not thou wilt do every thing he pleases, if thou hast not already.\n",
      "Why now tell me, Pamela, from thy heart, hast thou not been in bed with\n",
      "thy master? Ha, wench!--I was quite shocked at this, and said, I wonder\n",
      "how your ladyship can use me thus!--I am sure you can expect no answer;\n",
      "and my sex, and my tender years, might exempt me from such treatment,\n",
      "from a person of your ladyship's birth and quality, and who, be the\n",
      "distance ever so great, is of the same sex with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thou art a confident wench, said she, I see!--Pray, madam, said I, let\n",
      "me beg you to permit me to go. I am waited for in the town, to dinner.\n",
      "No, replied she, I can't spare you; and whomsoever you are to go to,\n",
      "will excuse you, when they are told 'tis I that command you not to\n",
      "go;--and you may excuse it too, young Lady Would-be, if you consider,\n",
      "that it is the unexpected coming of your late lady's daughter, and your\n",
      "master's sister, that commands your stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a pre-engagement, your ladyship will consider, is something.--Ay,\n",
      "so it is; but I know not what reason waiting-maids have to assume these\n",
      "airs of pre-engagements! Oh, Pamela, Pamela, I am sorry for thy thus\n",
      "aping thy betters, and giving thyself such airs: I see thou'rt quite\n",
      "spoiled! Of a modest, innocent girl, that thou wast, and humble too,\n",
      "thou art now fit for nothing in the world, but what I fear thou art.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, please your ladyship, said her kinsman, what signifies all you say?\n",
      "The matter's over with her, no doubt; and she likes it; and she is in a\n",
      "fairy-dream, and 'tis pity to awaken her before her dream's out.--Bad\n",
      "as you take me to be, madam, said I, I am not used to such language or\n",
      "reflections as this gentleman bestows upon me; and I won't bear it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Jackey, said she, be silent; and, shaking her head, Poor\n",
      "girl!--said she--what a sweet innocence is here destroyed!--A thousand\n",
      "pities!--I could cry over her, if that would do her good! But she is\n",
      "quite lost, quite undone; and then has assumed a carriage upon it, that\n",
      "all those creatures are distinguished by!\n",
      "\n",
      "I cried sadly for vexation; and said, Say what you please, madam; if I\n",
      "can help it, I will not answer another word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes came in, and asked if her ladyship was ready for dinner? She\n",
      "said, Yes. I would have gone out with her but my lady said, taking my\n",
      "hand, she could not spare me. And, miss, said she, you may pull off your\n",
      "gloves, and lay your fan by, for you shan't go; and, if you behave well,\n",
      "you shall wait upon me at dinner, and then I shall have a little further\n",
      "talk with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes said to me, Madam, may I speak one word with you?--I can't\n",
      "tell, Mrs. Jewkes, said I; for my lady holds my hand, and you see I am a\n",
      "kind of prisoner.\n",
      "\n",
      "What you have to say, Mrs. Jewkes, said she, you may speak before me.\n",
      "But she went out, and seemed vexed for me; and she says, I looked like\n",
      "the very scarlet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cloth was laid in another parlour, and for three persons, and she\n",
      "led me in: Come, my little dear, said she, with a sneer, I'll hand you\n",
      "in; and I would have you think it as well as if it was my brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a sad case, thought I, should I be in, if I were as naughty as she\n",
      "thinks me! It was bad enough as it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jackey, said my lady, come, let us go to dinner. She said to her\n",
      "woman, Do you, Beck, help Pamela to 'tend us; we will have no\n",
      "men-fellows.--Come, my young lady, shall I help you off with your white\n",
      "gloves? I have not, madam, said I, deserved this at your ladyship's\n",
      "hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes, coming in with the first dish, she said, Do you expect any\n",
      "body else, Mrs. Jewkes, that you lay the cloth for three? said she, I\n",
      "hoped your ladyship and madam would have been so well reconciled, that\n",
      "she would have sat down too.--What means the clownish woman? said my\n",
      "lady, in great disdain: Could you think the creature should sit down\n",
      "with me? She does, madam, and please your ladyship, with my master.--I\n",
      "doubt it not, good woman, said she, and lies with him too, does she not?\n",
      "Answer me, fat-face!--How these ladies are privileged.\n",
      "\n",
      "If she does, madam, said she, there may be a reason for it, perhaps!\n",
      "and went out.--So! said she, has the wench got thee over too? Come,\n",
      "my little dear, pull off thy gloves, I say; and off she pulled my left\n",
      "glove herself, and spied my ring. O my dear God! said she, if the wench\n",
      "has not got a ring!--Well, this is a pretty piece of foolery, indeed!\n",
      "Dost know, my friend, that thou art miserably tricked? And so, poor\n",
      "innocent, thou hast made a fine exchange, hast thou not? Thy honesty for\n",
      "this bauble? And, I'll warrant, my little dear has topped her part, and\n",
      "paraded it like any real wife; and so mimics still the condition!--Why,\n",
      "said she, and turned me round, thou art as mincing as any bride! No\n",
      "wonder thou art thus tricked out, and talkest of thy pre-engagements!\n",
      "Pr'ythee, child, walk before me to that glass; survey thyself, and come\n",
      "back to me, that I may see how finely thou can'st act the theatrical\n",
      "part given thee!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was then resolved to try to be silent, although most sadly vexed.--So\n",
      "I went and sat me down in the window, and she took her place at the\n",
      "upper end of the table; and her saucy Jackey, fleering at me most\n",
      "provokingly, sat down by her. Said he, Shall not the bride sit down by\n",
      "us, madam? Ay, well thought of! said my lady: Pray, Mrs. Bride, your\n",
      "pardon for sitting down in your place!--I said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said she, with a poor pun, Thou hast some modesty, however, child! for\n",
      "thou can'st not stand it, so must sit down, though in my presence!--I\n",
      "still kept my seat, and said nothing.--Thought I, this is a sad thing,\n",
      "that I am hindered too from shewing my duty where it is most due, and\n",
      "shall have anger there too, may be, if my dear master should be there\n",
      "before me!--So she ate some soup, as did her kinsman; and then, as she\n",
      "was cutting up a fowl, said, If thou longest, my little dear, I will\n",
      "help thee to a pinion, or breast, or any thing. But may be, child, said\n",
      "he, thou likest the rump; shall I bring it thee? And then laughed like\n",
      "an idiot, for all he is a lord's son, and may be a lord himself.--For he\n",
      "is the son of Lord ----; and his mother, who was Lord Davers's sister,\n",
      "being dead, he has received what education he has, from Lord Davers's\n",
      "direction. Poor wretch! for all his greatness! he'll ne'er die for a\n",
      "plot--at least of his own hatching. If I could then have gone up, I\n",
      "would have given you his picture. But, for one of 25 or 26 years of age,\n",
      "much about the age of my dear master, he is a most odd mortal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pamela, said my lady, help me to a glass of wine. No, Beck, said she,\n",
      "you shan't; for she was offering to do it. I will have my lady bride\n",
      "confer that honour upon me; and then I shall see if she can stand up. I\n",
      "was silent, and never stirred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dost hear, chastity? said she, help me to a glass of wine, when I bid\n",
      "thee.--What! not stir? Then I'll come and help thee to one. Still I\n",
      "stirred not, and, fanning myself, continued silent. Said she, When I\n",
      "have asked thee, meek-one, half a dozen questions together, I suppose\n",
      "thou wilt answer them all at once! Pretty creature, is not that it?\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so vexed, I bit a piece of my fan out, not knowing what I did; but\n",
      "still I said nothing, and did nothing but flutter it, and fan myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe, said she, my next question will make up half a dozen; and\n",
      "then, modest one, I shall be entitled to an answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "He rose and brought the bottle and glass; Come, said he, Mrs. Bride, be\n",
      "pleased to help my lady, and I will be your deputy. Sir, replied I, it\n",
      "is in a good hand; help my lady yourself.--Why, creature, said she, dost\n",
      "thou think thyself above it?--And then flew into a passion:--Insolence!\n",
      "continued she, this moment, when I bid you, know your duty, and give me\n",
      "a glass of wine; or--\n",
      "\n",
      "So I took a little spirit then--Thought I, I can but be beat.--If, said\n",
      "I, to attend your ladyship at table, or even kneel at your feet, was\n",
      "required of me, I would most gladly do it, were I only the person you\n",
      "think me; but, if it be to triumph over one who has received honours,\n",
      "that she thinks require her to act another part, not to be utterly\n",
      "unworthy of them, I must say, I cannot do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She seemed quite surprised, and looked now upon her kinsman, and then\n",
      "upon her woman--I'm astonished--quite astonished!--Well, then, I suppose\n",
      "you would have me conclude you my brother's wife; could you not?\n",
      "\n",
      "Your ladyship, said I, compels me to say this!--Well, returned she, but\n",
      "dost thou thyself think thou art so?--Silence, said her kinsman, gives\n",
      "consent. 'Tis plain enough she does. Shall I rise, madam, and pay my\n",
      "duty to my new aunt?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tell me, said my lady, what, in the name of impudence, possesses thee\n",
      "to dare to look upon thyself as my sister?--Madam, replied I, that is a\n",
      "question will better become your most worthy brother to answer, than me.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was rising in great wrath: but her woman said, Good your ladyship,\n",
      "you'll do yourself more harm than her; and if the poor girl has been\n",
      "deluded so, as you have heard, with the sham marriage, she'll be more\n",
      "deserving of your ladyship's pity than anger. True, Beck, very true,\n",
      "said my lady; but there's no bearing the impudence of the creature in\n",
      "the mean time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would have gone out at the door, but her kinsman ran and set his back\n",
      "against it. I expected bad treatment from her pride, and violent temper;\n",
      "but this was worse than I could have thought of. And I said to him, Sir,\n",
      "when my master comes to know your rude behaviour, you will, may be, have\n",
      "cause to repent it: and went and sat down in the window again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another challenge, by gad! said he; but I am glad she says her\n",
      "master!--You see, madam, she herself does not believe she is married,\n",
      "and so has not been so much deluded as you think for: And, coming to\n",
      "me with a most barbarous air of insult, he said, kneeling on one knee\n",
      "before me, My new aunt, your blessing or your curse, I care not which;\n",
      "but quickly give me one or other, that I may not lose my dinner!\n",
      "\n",
      "I gave him a most contemptuous look: Tinselled toy, said I, (for he was\n",
      "laced all over), twenty or thirty years hence, when you are at age, I\n",
      "shall know how to answer you better; mean time, sport with your footman,\n",
      "and not with me! and so I removed to another window nearer the door, and\n",
      "he looked like a sad fool, as he is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beck, Beck, said my lady, this is not to be borne! Was ever the like\n",
      "heard! Is my kinsman and Lord Davers's to be thus used by such a slut?\n",
      "And was coming to me: And indeed I began to be afraid; for I have but\n",
      "a poor heart, after all. But Mrs. Jewkes hearing high words, came in\n",
      "again, with the second course, and said, Pray your ladyship, don't so\n",
      "discompose yourself. I am afraid this day's business will make matters\n",
      "wider than ever between your good ladyship and your brother: For my\n",
      "master doats upon madam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Woman, said she, do thou be silent! Sure, I that was born in this house,\n",
      "may have some privilege in it, without being talked to by the saucy\n",
      "servants in it!\n",
      "\n",
      "I beg pardon, madam, replied Mrs. Jewkes; and, turning to me, said,\n",
      "Madam, my master will take it very ill if you make him wait for you\n",
      "thus. So I rose to go out; but my lady said, If it was only for that\n",
      "reason she shan't go.--And went to the door and shut it, and said to\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes, Woman, don't come again till I call you; and coming to me,\n",
      "took my hand, and said, Find your legs, miss, if you please.\n",
      "\n",
      "I stood up, and she tapped my cheek! Oh, says she, that scarlet glow\n",
      "shews what a rancorous little heart thou hast, if thou durst shew it!\n",
      "but come this way; and so led me to her chair: Stand there, said she,\n",
      "and answer me a few questions while I dine, and I'll dismiss thee, till\n",
      "I call thy impudent master to account; and then I'll have you face to\n",
      "face, and all this mystery of iniquity shall be unravelled; for, between\n",
      "you, I will come to the bottom of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she had sat down, I moved to the window on the other side of the\n",
      "parlour, looking into the private garden; and her woman said, Mrs.\n",
      "Pamela, don't make my lady angry. Stand by her ladyship, as she bids\n",
      "you. Said I, Pray, good now, let it suffice you to attend your lady's\n",
      "commands, and don't lay yours upon me.--Your pardon, sweet Mrs. Pamela,\n",
      "said she. Times are much altered with you, I'll assure you! said I, Her\n",
      "ladyship has a very good plea to be free in the house that she was born\n",
      "in; but you may as well confine your freedoms to the house in which\n",
      "you had your breedings. Why, how now, Mrs. Pamela, said she; since you\n",
      "provoke me to it, I'll tell you a piece of my mind. Hush, hush, good\n",
      "woman, said I, alluding to my lady's language to Mrs. Jewkes, my lady\n",
      "wants not your assistance:--Besides, I can't scold!\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman was ready to flutter with vexation; and Lord Jackey laughed as\n",
      "if he would burst his sides: G--d d--n me, Beck, said he, you'd better\n",
      "let her alone to my lady here for she'll be too many for twenty such\n",
      "as you and I!--And then he laughed again, and repeated--I can't scold,\n",
      "quoth-a! but, by gad, miss, you can speak d----d spiteful words, I\n",
      "can tell you that!--Poor Beck, poor Beck!--'Fore gad, she's quite\n",
      "dumbfoundered!\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, but Pamela, said my lady, come hither, and tell me truly, Dost\n",
      "thou think thyself really married?--Said I, and approached her chair, My\n",
      "good lady, I'll answer all your commands, if you'll have patience with\n",
      "me, and not be so angry as you are: But I can't bear to be used thus\n",
      "by this gentleman, and your ladyship's woman. Child, said she, thou art\n",
      "very impertinent to my kinsman; thou can'st not be civil to me; and my\n",
      "ladyship's woman is much thy betters. But that's not the thing!--Dost\n",
      "thou think thou art really married?\n",
      "\n",
      "I see, madam, said I, you are resolved not to be pleased with any answer\n",
      "I shall return: If I should say, I am not, then your ladyship will call\n",
      "me hard names, and, perhaps, I should tell a fib. If I should say, I\n",
      "am, your ladyship will ask, how I have the impudence to be so?--and will\n",
      "call it a sham-marriage. I will, said she, be answered more directly.\n",
      "Why, what, madam, does it signify what I think? Your ladyship will\n",
      "believe as you please.\n",
      "\n",
      "But can'st thou have the vanity, the pride, the folly, said she, to\n",
      "think thyself actually married to my brother? He is no fool, child; and\n",
      "libertine enough of conscience; and thou art not the first in the\n",

      "flutter,) as I am easy, and pleased with my lot, pray, madam, let me\n",
      "continue so, as long as I can. It will be time enough for me to know the\n",
      "worst, when the worst comes. And if it should be so bad, your ladyship\n",
      "should pity me, rather than thus torment me before my time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said she, but dost not think I am concerned, that a young wench,\n",
      "whom my poor dear mother loved so well, should thus cast herself away,\n",
      "and suffer herself to be deluded and undone, after such a noble stand as\n",
      "thou madst for so long a time?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think myself far from being deluded and undone, and am as innocent and\n",
      "virtuous as ever I was in my life. Thou liest, child, said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "So your ladyship told me twice before.\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave me a slap on the hand for this; and I made a low courtesy, and\n",
      "said, I humbly thank your ladyship! but I could not refrain tears: And\n",
      "added, Your dear brother, madam, however, won't thank your ladyship for\n",
      "this usage of me, though I do. Come a little nearer me, my dear, said\n",
      "she, and thou shalt have a little more than that to tell him of, if thou\n",
      "think'st thou hast not made mischief enough already between a sister and\n",
      "brother. But, child, if he was here, I would serve thee worse, and him\n",
      "too. I wish he was, said I.--Dost thou threaten me, mischief-maker, and\n",
      "insolent as thou art?\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, pray, madam, said I, (but got to a little distance,) be pleased to\n",
      "reflect upon all that you have said to me, since I have had the honour,\n",
      "or rather misfortune, to come into your presence; whether you have said\n",
      "one thing befitting your ladyship's degree to me, even supposing I was\n",
      "the wench and the creature you imagine me to be?--Come hither, my pert\n",
      "dear, replied she, come but within my reach for one moment, and I'll\n",
      "answer thee as thou deservest.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure she meant to box my ears. But I should not be worthy my happy\n",
      "lot if I could not shew some spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the cloth was taken away, I said, I suppose I may now depart your\n",
      "presence, madam? I suppose not, said she. Why, I'll lay thee a wager,\n",
      "child, thy stomach's too full to eat, and so thou may'st fast till thy\n",
      "mannerly master comes home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pray your ladyship, said her woman, let the poor girl sit down at table\n",
      "with Mrs. Jewkes and me.--Said I, You are very kind, Mrs. Worden; but\n",
      "times, as you said, are much altered with me; and I have been of late so\n",
      "much honoured with better company, that I can't stoop to yours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was ever such confidence! said my lady.--Poor Beck! poor Beck! said her\n",
      "kinsman; why she beats you quite out of the pit!--Will your ladyship,\n",
      "said I, be so good as to tell me how long I am to tarry? For you'll\n",
      "please to see by that letter, that I am obliged to attend my master's\n",
      "commands. And so I gave her the dear gentleman's letter from Mr.\n",
      "Carlton's, which I thought would make her use me better, as she might\n",
      "judge by it of the honour done me by him. Ay, said she, this is my\n",
      "worthy brother's hand. It is directed to Mrs. Andrews. That's to you, I\n",
      "suppose, child? And so she ran on, making remarks as she went along, in\n",
      "this manner:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My dearest PAMELA,--'Mighty well!'--I hope my not coming home this\n",

      "frighten you, child?'--You may believe I can't help it. 'No, to be\n",
      "sure!--A person in thy way of life, is more tenderly used than an honest\n",
      "wife. But mark the end of it!'--I could have wished--'Pr'ythee, Jackey,\n",
      "mind this,'--we--'mind the significant we,'--had not engaged to the good\n",
      "neighbourhood, at Sir Simon's, for to-morrow night.--'Why, does the good\n",
      "neighbourhood, and does Sir Simon, permit thy visits, child? They shall\n",
      "have none of mine, then, I'll assure them!'--But I am so desirous to set\n",
      "out on Wednesday for the other house--'So, Jackey, but we just nicked\n",
      "it, I find:'--that, as well as in return for the civilities of so\n",
      "many good friends, who will be there on purpose, I would not put it\n",
      "off.--'Now mind, Jackey.'--What I beg of you--'Mind the wretch, that\n",

      "you!--I wish I may not be quite sick before I get through.'--What I beg\n",
      "of you, therefore, my dear, [and then she looked me full in the face,]\n",
      "is, that you will go in the chariot to Sir Simon's, the sooner in the\n",
      "day the better;--'Dear heart! and why so, when WE were not expected till\n",
      "night? Why, pray observe the reason--Hem!' [said she]--Because you will\n",
      "be diverted with the company;--'Mighty kind, indeed!'--who all--'Jackey,\n",

      "hanged before he would have said so complaisant a thing, had he\n",
      "been married, I'm sure!'--Very true, aunt, said he: A plain case\n",
      "that!--[Thought I, that's hard upon poor matrimony, though I hope my\n",
      "lady don't find it so. But I durst not speak out.]--Who all so much\n",
      "admire you, [said she,] 'I must repeat that--Pretty miss!--I wish thou\n",
      "wast as admirable for thy virtue, as for that baby-face of thine!'--And\n",
      "I hope to join you there by your tea-time in the afternoon!--'So, you're\n",
      "in very good time, child, an hour or two hence, to answer all your\n",
      "important pre-engagements!'--which will be better than going home, and\n",
      "returning with you; as it will be six miles difference to me; and I know\n",
      "the good company will excuse my dress on this occasion.--'Very true; any\n",
      "dress is good enough, I'm sure, for such company as admire thee, child,\n",
      "for a companion, in thy ruined state!--Jackey, Jackey, mind, mind,\n",
      "again! more fine things still!'--I count every hour of this little\n",
      "absence for a day!--'There's for you! Let me repeat it'--I count every\n",
      "hour of this little absence for a day!--'Mind, too, the wit of the good\n",
      "man! One may see love is a new thing to him. Here is a very tedious\n",
      "time gone since he saw his deary; no less than, according to his amorous\n",
      "calculation, a dozen days and nights, at least! and yet, TEDIOUS as\n",
      "it is, it is but a LITTLE ABSENCE. Well said, my good, accurate, and\n",
      "consistent brother!--But wise men in love are always the greatest\n",
      "simpletons!--But now cones the reason why this LITTLE ABSENCE, which, at\n",
      "the same time, is SO GREAT an ABSENCE, is so tedious:'--FOR I am--'Ay,\n",
      "now for it!'--with the UTMOST sincerity, my dearest love--'Out upon\n",

      "what shall I call you? Your dearest love will be for ever yours! And\n",
      "hast thou the vanity to believe this?--But stay, here is a postscript.\n",
      "The poor man knew not when to have done to his dearest love.--He's sadly\n",
      "in for't, truly! Why, his dearest love, you are mighty happy in such a\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, so much for this kind letter! But you see you cannot honour this\n",
      "admiring company with this little expected, and, but in complaisance\n",
      "to his folly, I dare say, little desired freedom. And I cannot forbear\n",
      "admiring you so much myself, my dearest love, that I will not spare\n",
      "you at all, this whole evening: For 'tis a little hard, if thy master's\n",

      "\n",
      "So I found I had shewn her my letter to very little purpose, and\n",
      "repented it several times, as she read on.--Well, then, said I, I\n",
      "hope your ladyship will give me leave to send my excuses to your good\n",
      "brother, and say, that your ladyship is come, and is so fond of me, that\n",
      "you will not let me leave you.--Pretty creature, said she; and wantest\n",
      "thou thy good master to come, and quarrel with his sister on thy\n",
      "account?--But thou shalt not stir from my presence; and I would now ask\n",
      "thee, What it is thou meanest by shewing me this letter?--Why, madam,\n",
      "said I, to shew your ladyship how I was engaged for this day and\n",
      "evening.--And for nothing else? said she. Why, I can't tell, madam, said\n",
      "I: But if you can collect from it any other circumstances, I might hope\n",
      "I should not be the worse treated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw her eyes began to sparkle with passion: and she took my hand,\n",
      "and said, grasping it very hard, I know, confident creature, that thou\n",
      "shewedst it me to insult me!--You shewed it me, to let me see, that\n",
      "he could be civiller to a beggar born, than to me, or to my good Lord\n",
      "Davers!--You shewed it me, as if you'd have me to be as credulous a fool\n",
      "as yourself, to believe your marriage true, when I know the whole trick\n",
      "of it, and have reason to believe you do too; and you shewed it me, to\n",
      "upbraid me with his stooping to such painted dirt, to the disgrace of a\n",
      "family, ancient and untainted beyond most in the kingdom. And now will I\n",
      "give thee one hundred guineas for one bold word, that I may fell thee at\n",
      "my foot!\n",
      "\n",
      "Was not this very dreadful! To be sure, I had better have kept the\n",
      "letter from her. I was quite frightened!--And this fearful menace,\n",
      "and her fiery eyes, and rageful countenance, made me lose all my\n",
      "courage.--So I said, weeping, Good your ladyship, pity me!--Indeed I am\n",
      "honest; indeed I am virtuous; indeed I would not do a bad thing for the\n",
      "world!\n",
      "\n",
      "Though I know, said she, the whole trick of thy pretended marriage, and\n",
      "thy foolish ring here, and all the rest of the wicked nonsense, yet I\n",
      "should not have patience with thee, if thou shouldst but offer to let\n",
      "me know thy vanity prompts thee to believe thou art married to my\n",
      "brother!--I could not bear the thought!--So take care, Pamela; take\n",
      "care, beggarly brat; take care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good madam, said I, spare my dear parents. They are honest and\n",
      "industrious: they were once in a very creditable way, and never were\n",
      "beggars. Misfortunes may attend any body: And I can bear the cruellest\n",
      "imputations on myself, because I know my innocence; but upon such\n",
      "honest, industrious parents, who went through the greatest trials,\n",
      "without being beholden to any thing but God's blessing, and their own\n",
      "hard labour; I cannot bear reflection.\n",
      "\n",
      "What! art thou setting up for a family, creature as thou art! God give\n",
      "me patience with thee! I suppose my brother's folly, and his wickedness,\n",
      "together, will, in a little while, occasion a search at the heralds'\n",
      "office, to set out thy wretched obscurity! Provoke me, I desire thou\n",
      "wilt! One hundred guineas will I give thee, to say but thou thinkest\n",
      "thou art married to my brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your ladyship, I hope, won't kill me: And since nothing I can say will\n",
      "please you, but your ladyship is resolved to quarrel with me; since\n",
      "I must not say what I think, on one hand nor another; whatever your\n",
      "ladyship designs by me, be pleased to do, and let me depart your\n",
      "presence!\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave me a slap on the hand, and reached to box my ear; but Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes hearkening without, and her woman too, they both came in at\n",
      "that instant; and Mrs. Jewkes said, pushing herself in between us; Your\n",
      "ladyship knows not what you do! Indeed you don't! My master would never\n",
      "forgive me, if I suffered, in his house, one he so dearly loves, to be\n",
      "so used; and it must not be, though you are Lady Davers. Her woman too\n",
      "interposed, and told her, I was not worth her ladyship's anger. But she\n",
      "was like a person beside herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I offered to go out, and Mrs. Jewkes took my hand to lead me out: But\n",
      "her kinsman set his back against the door, and put his hand to his\n",
      "sword, and said, I should not go, till his aunt permitted it. He drew it\n",
      "half-way, and I was so terrified, that I cried out, Oh, the sword!\n",
      "the sword! and, not knowing what I did, I ran to my lady herself, and\n",
      "clasped my arms about her, forgetting, just then, how much she was my\n",
      "enemy, and said, sinking on my knees, Defend me, good your ladyship! the\n",
      "sword! the sword!--Mrs. Jewkes said, Oh! my lady will fall into fits!\n",
      "But Lady Davers was herself so startled at the matter being carried so\n",
      "far, that she did not mind her words, and said, Jackey, don't draw your\n",
      "sword!--You see, as great as her spirit is, she can't bear that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Come, said she, be comforted; he shan't frighten you!--I'll try to\n",
      "overcome my anger, and will pity you. So, wench, rise up, and don't be\n",
      "foolish. Mrs. Jewkes held her salts to my nose, and I did not faint. And\n",
      "my lady said, Mrs. Jewkes, if you would be forgiven, leave Pamela and me\n",
      "by ourselves; and, Jackey, do you withdraw; only you, Beck, stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I sat down in the window, all in a sad fluster; for, to be sure, I\n",
      "was sadly frightened.--Said her woman, You should not sit in my lady's\n",
      "presence, Mrs. Pamela. Yes, let her sit till she is a little recovered\n",
      "of her fright, said my lady, and do you set my chair by her. And so she\n",
      "sat over-against me, and said, To be sure, Pamela, you have been very\n",
      "provoking with your tongue, to be sure you have, as well upon my nephew,\n",
      "(who is a man of quality too,) as me. And palliating her cruel usage,\n",
      "and beginning, I suppose, to think herself she had carried it further\n",
      "than she could answer it to her brother, she wanted to lay the fault\n",
      "upon me. Own, said she, you have been very saucy; and beg my pardon,\n",
      "and beg Jackey's pardon, and I will try to pity you. For you are a sweet\n",
      "girl, after all; if you had but held out, and been honest.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tis injurious to me, madam, said I, to imagine I am not honest!--Said\n",
      "she, Have you not been a-bed with my brother? tell me that. Your\n",
      "ladyship, replied I, asks your questions in a strange way, and in\n",
      "strange words.\n",
      "\n",
      "O! your delicacy is wounded, I suppose, by my plain questions!--This\n",
      "niceness will soon leave you, wench: It will, indeed. But answer me\n",
      "directly. Then your ladyship's next question, said I, will be, Am I\n",
      "married? And you won't bear my answer to that--and will beat me again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I han't beat you yet; have I, Beck? said she. So you want to make out a\n",
      "story, do you?--But, indeed, I can't bear thou shouldst so much as\n",
      "think thou art my sister. I know the whole trick of it; and so, 'tis my\n",
      "opinion, dost thou. It is only thy little cunning, that it might look\n",
      "like a cloak to thy yielding, and get better terms from him. Pr'ythee,\n",
      "pr'ythee, wench, thou seest I know the world a little;--almost as much\n",
      "at thirty-two, as thou dost at sixteen.--Remember that!\n",
      "\n",
      "I rose from the window, and walking to the other end of the room, Beat\n",
      "me again, if you please, said I, but I must tell your ladyship, I scorn\n",
      "your words, and am as much married as your ladyship!\n",
      "\n",
      "At that she ran to me; but her woman interposed again: Let the vain\n",
      "wicked creature go from your presence, madam, said she. She is not\n",
      "worthy to be in it. She will but vex your ladyship. Stand away, Beck,\n",
      "said she. That's an assertion that I would not take from my brother, I\n",
      "can't bear it. As much married as I!--Is that to be borne? But if the\n",
      "creature believes she is, madam, said her woman, she is to be as much\n",
      "pitied for her credulity, as despised for her vanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was in hopes to have slipt out at the door; but she caught hold of my\n",
      "gown, and pulled me back. Pray your ladyship, said I, don't kill me!--I\n",
      "have done no harm.--But she locked the door, and put the key in her\n",
      "pocket. So, seeing Mrs. Jewkes before the window, I lifted up the sash,\n",
      "and said, Mrs. Jewkes, I believe it would be best for the chariot to go\n",
      "to your master, and let him know, that Lady Davers is here; and I cannot\n",
      "leave her ladyship.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was resolved to be displeased, let me say what I would.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said she, No, no; he'll then think, that I make the creature my\n",
      "companion, and know not how to part with her. I thought your ladyship,\n",
      "replied I, could not have taken exceptions at this message. Thou knowest\n",
      "nothing, wench, said she, of what belongs to people of condition: How\n",
      "shouldst thou? Nor, thought I, do I desire it, at this rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "What shall I say, madam? said I. Nothing at all, replied she; let him\n",
      "expect his dearest love, and be disappointed; it is but adding a\n",
      "few more hours, and he will make every one a day, in his amorous\n",
      "account.--Mrs. Jewkes coming nearer me, and my lady walking about the\n",
      "room, being then at the end, I whispered, Let Robert stay at the elms;\n",
      "I'll have a struggle for't by and by.\n",
      "\n",
      "As much married as I! repeated she.--The insolence of the creature!--And\n",
      "so she walked about the room, talking to herself, to her woman, and\n",
      "now and then to me; but seeing I could not please her, I thought I\n",
      "had better be silent. And then it was, Am I not worthy an answer? If\n",
      "I speak, said I, your ladyship is angry at me, though ever so\n",
      "respectfully; if I do not, I cannot please: Would your ladyship tell me\n",
      "but how I shall oblige you, and I would do it with all my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Confess the truth, said she, that thou art an undone creature; hast been\n",
      "in bed with thy master; and art sorry for it, and for the mischief\n",
      "thou hast occasioned between him and me; and then I'll pity thee, and\n",
      "persuade him to pack thee off, with a hundred or two of guineas; and\n",
      "some honest farmer may take pity of thee, and patch up thy shame, for\n",
      "the sake of the money; and if nobody will have thee, thou must vow\n",
      "penitence, and be as humble as I once thought thee.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was quite sick at heart, at all this passionate extravagance, and to\n",
      "be hindered from being where was the desire of my soul, and afraid too\n",
      "of incurring my dear master's displeasure; and, as I sat, I saw it was\n",
      "no hard matter to get out of the window into the front yard, the parlour\n",
      "being even with the yard, and so have a fair run for it; and after I had\n",
      "seen my lady at the other end of the room again, in her walks, having\n",
      "not pulled down the sash, when I spoke to Mrs. Jewkes, I got upon the\n",
      "seat, and whipped out in a minute, and ran away as hard as I could\n",
      "drive, my lady calling after me to return, and her woman at the other\n",
      "window: But two of her servants appearing at her crying out, and she\n",
      "bidding them to stop me, I said, Touch me at your peril, fellows!\n",
      "But their lady's commands would have prevailed on them, had not Mr.\n",
      "Colbrand, who, it seems, had been kindly ordered, by Mrs. Jewkes, to be\n",
      "within call, when she saw how I was treated, come up, and put on one of\n",
      "his deadly fierce looks, the only time, I thought, it ever became him,\n",
      "and said, He would chine the man, that was his word, who offered to\n",
      "touch his lady; and so he ran alongside of me; and I heard my lady say,\n",
      "The creature flies like a bird! And, indeed, Mr. Colbrand, with his huge\n",
      "strides, could hardly keep pace with me; and I never stopped, till I\n",
      "got to the chariot; and Robert had got down, seeing me running at a\n",
      "distance, and held the door in his hand, with the step ready down; and\n",
      "in I jumped, without touching the step, saying, Drive me, drive me, as\n",
      "fast as you can, out of my lady's reach! And he mounted; and Colbrand\n",
      "said, Don't be frightened, madam; nobody shall hurt you.--And shut the\n",
      "door, and away Robert drove; but I was quite out of breath, and did not\n",
      "recover it, and my fright, all the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Colbrand was so kind, but I did not know it till the chariot stopped\n",
      "at Sir Simon's, to step up behind the carriage, lest, as he said, my\n",
      "lady should send after me; and he told Mrs. Jewkes, when he got home,\n",
      "that he never saw such a runner as me in his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the chariot stopped, which was not till six o'clock, so long did\n",
      "this cruel lady keep me, Miss Darnford ran out to me: O madam, said she,\n",
      "ten times welcome! but you'll be beat, I can tell you! for here has been\n",
      "Mr. B---- come these two hours, and is very angry with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's hard indeed, said I;--Indeed I can't afford it;--for I hardly\n",
      "knew what I said, having not recovered my fright. Let me sit down, miss,\n",
      "any where, said I; for I have been sadly off. So I sat down, and was\n",
      "quite sick with the hurry of my spirits, and leaned upon her arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said she, Your lord and master came in very moody; and when he had staid\n",
      "an hour, and you not come, he began to fret, and said, He did not expect\n",
      "so little complaisance from you. And he is now sat down, with great\n",
      "persuasion, to a game at loo.--Come, you must make your appearance, lady\n",
      "fair; for he is too sullen to attend you, I doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have no strangers, have you miss? said I.--Only two women relations\n",
      "from Stamford, replied she, and an humble servant of one of them.--Only\n",
      "all the world, miss! said I.--What shall I do, if he be angry? I can't\n",
      "bear that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as I had said so, came in Lady Darnford and Lady Jones to chide me,\n",
      "as they said, for not coming sooner. And before I could speak, came in\n",
      "my dear master. I ran to him. How dy'e Pamela? said he; and saluting me,\n",
      "with a little more formality than I could well bear.--I expected half\n",
      "a word from me, when I was so complaisant to your choice, would have\n",
      "determined you, and that you'd have been here to dinner;--and the\n",
      "rather, as I made my request a reasonable one, and what I thought would\n",
      "be agreeable to you. O dear sir, said I, pray, pray, hear me, and you'll\n",
      "pity me, and not be displeased! Mrs. Jewkes will tell you, that as\n",
      "soon as I had your kind commands, I said, I would obey you, and come to\n",
      "dinner with these good ladies; and so prepared myself instantly, with\n",
      "all the pleasure in the world. Lady Darnford and miss said I was their\n",
      "dear!--Look you, said miss, did I not tell you, stately one, that\n",
      "something must have happened? But, O these tyrants! these men!\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, what hindered it, my dear? said he: give yourself time; you seem\n",
      "out of breath!--O sir, said I, out of breath! well I may!--For, just as\n",
      "I was ready to come away, who should drive into the court-yard, but Lady\n",
      "Davers!--Lady Davers! Nay, then, my sweet dear, said he, and saluted me\n",
      "more tenderly, hast thou had a worse trial than I wish thee, from one\n",
      "of the haughtiest women in England, though my sister!--For, she too, my\n",
      "Pamela, was spoiled by my good mother!--But have you seen her?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, sir, said I, and more than seen her!--Why sure, said he, she has\n",
      "not had the insolence to strike my girl!--Sir, said I, but tell me you\n",
      "forgive me; for indeed I could not come sooner; and these good ladies\n",
      "but excuse me; and I'll tell you all another time; for to take up the\n",
      "good company's attention now, will spoil their pleasantry, and be to\n",
      "them, though more important to me, like the broken china you cautioned\n",
      "me about.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a dear girl! said he; I see my hints are not thrown away upon\n",
      "you; and I beg pardon for being angry with you; and, for the future,\n",
      "will stay till I hear your defence, before I judge you. Said Miss\n",
      "Darnford, This is a little better! To own a fault is some reparation;\n",
      "and what every lordly husband will not do. He said, But tell me, my\n",
      "dear, did Lady Davers offer you any incivility? O sir, replied I, she\n",
      "is your sister, and I must not tell you all; but she has used me very\n",
      "severely! Did you tell her, said he, you were married? Yes, sir, I did\n",
      "at last; but she will have it 'tis a sham-marriage, and that I am a vile\n",
      "creature: and she was ready to beat me, when I said so: for she could\n",
      "not have patience, that I should be deemed her sister, as she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "How unlucky it was, replied he, I was not at home?--Why did you not send\n",
      "to me here? Send, sir! I was kept prisoner by force. They would not let\n",
      "me stir, or do you think I would have been hindered from obeying you?\n",
      "Nay, I told them, that I had a pre-engagement; but she ridiculed me, and\n",
      "said, Waiting-maids talk of pre-engagements! And then I shewed her your\n",
      "kind letter; and she made a thousand remarks upon it, and made me wish\n",
      "I had not. In short, whatever I could do or say, there was no pleasing\n",
      "her; and I was a creature and wench, and all that was naught. But you\n",
      "must not be angry with her on my account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, but, said he, I suppose she hardly asked you to dine with her; for\n",
      "she came before dinner, I presume, if it was soon after you had received\n",
      "my letter! No, sir, dine with my lady! no, indeed! Why, she would make\n",
      "me wait at table upon her, with her woman, because she would not expose\n",
      "herself and me before the men-servants; which you know, sir, was very\n",
      "good of her ladyship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said he, but did you wait upon her? Would you have had me,\n",
      "sir? said I.--Only, Pamela, replied he, if you did, and knew not what\n",
      "belonged to your character, as my wife, I shall be very angry with you.\n",
      "Sir, said I, I did not, but refused it, out of consideration to the\n",
      "dignity you have raised me to; else, sir, I could have waited on my\n",
      "knees upon your sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, said he, you confirm my opinion of your prudence and judgment. She\n",
      "is an insolent woman, and shall dearly repent it. But, sir, she is to be\n",
      "excused, because she won't believe I am indeed married; so don't be too\n",
      "angry at her ladyship.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, Ladies, pray don't let us keep you from the company; I'll only\n",
      "ask a question or two more, and attend you. Said Lady Jones, I so much\n",
      "long to hear this story of poor madam's persecution, that, if it was\n",
      "not improper, I should be glad to stay. Miss Darnford would stay for the\n",
      "same reason; my master saying, He had no secrets to ask; and that it was\n",
      "kind of them to interest themselves in my grievances.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Lady Darnford went into the company, and told them the cause of my\n",
      "detention; for, it seems, my dear master loved me too well, to keep to\n",
      "himself the disappointment my not being here to receive him, was to\n",
      "him; and they had all given the two Misses Boroughs and Mr. Perry,\n",
      "the Stamford guests, such a character of me, that they said they were\n",
      "impatient to see me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said my master, But, Pamela, you said they and them: Who had my sister\n",
      "with her besides her woman? Her nephew, sir, and three footmen on\n",
      "horseback; and she and her woman were in her chariot and six.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a sad coxcomb, said he: How did he behave to you?--Not\n",
      "extraordinarily, sir; but I should not complain; for I was even with\n",
      "him; because I thought I ought not to bear with him as with my lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "By Heaven! said he, if I knew he behaved unhandsomely to my jewel, I'd\n",
      "send him home to his uncle without his ears. Indeed, sir, returned I,\n",
      "I was as hard upon him as he was upon me. Said he, 'Tis kind to say so;\n",
      "but I believe I shall make them dearly repent their visit, if I find\n",
      "their behaviour to call for my resentment.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, sure, my dear, you might have got away when you went to your own\n",
      "dinner? Indeed, sir, said I, her ladyship locked me in, and would not\n",
      "let me stir.--So you ha'nt ate any dinner? No, indeed, sir, nor had a\n",
      "stomach for any. My poor dear, said he. But then, how got you away at\n",
      "last? O sir, replied I, I jumped out of the parlour window, and ran away\n",
      "to the chariot, which had waited for me several hours, by the elm-walk,\n",
      "from the time of my lady's coming (for I was just going, as I said); and\n",
      "Mr. Colbrand conducted me through her servants, whom she called to, to\n",
      "stop me; and was so kind to step behind the chariot, unknown to me, and\n",
      "saw me safe here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sure, said he, these insolent creatures must have treated you\n",
      "vilely. But tell me, what part did Mrs. Jewkes act in this affair? A\n",
      "very kind part, sir, said I, in my behalf; and I shall thank her for it.\n",
      "Sweet creature! said he, thou lovest to speak well of every body; but\n",
      "I hope she deserves it; for she knew you were married.--But come, we'll\n",
      "now join the company, and try to forget all you have suffered, for two\n",
      "or three hours, that we may not tire the company with our concerns\n",
      "and resume the subject as we go home: and you shall find I will do you\n",
      "justice, as I ought. But you forgive me, sir, said I, and are not angry?\n",
      "Forgive you, my dear! returned he--I hope you forgive me! I shall never\n",
      "make you satisfaction for what you have suffered from me, and for me!\n",
      "And with those words he led me into the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "He very kindly presented me to the two stranger ladies, and the\n",
      "gentleman, and them to me: and Sir Simon, who was at cards, rose from\n",
      "table, and saluted me: Adad! madam, said he, I'm glad to see you here.\n",
      "What, it seems you have been a prisoner! 'Twas well you was, or your\n",
      "spouse and I should have sat in judgment upon you, and condemned you to\n",
      "a fearful punishment for your first crime of laesae majestatis: (I had\n",
      "this explained to me afterwards, as a sort of treason against my liege\n",
      "lord and husband:) for we husbands hereabouts, said he, are resolved to\n",
      "turn over a new leaf with our wives, and your lord and master shall\n",
      "shew us the way, I can tell you that. But I see by your eyes, my sweet\n",
      "culprit, added he, and your complexion, you have had sour sauce to your\n",
      "sweet meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Darnford said, I think we are obliged to our sweet guest, at last;\n",
      "for she was forced to jump out at a window to come to us. Indeed! said\n",
      "Mrs. Peters;--and my master's back being turned, says she, Lady Davers,\n",
      "when a maiden, was always vastly passionate; but a very good lady when\n",
      "her passion was over. And she'd make nothing of slapping her maids\n",
      "about, and begging their pardons afterwards, if they took it patiently;\n",
      "otherwise she used to say the creatures were even with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ay, said I, I have been a many creatures and wenches, and I know not\n",
      "what; for these were the names she gave me. And I thought I ought to\n",
      "act up to the part her dear brother has given me; and so I have but just\n",
      "escaped a good cuffing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Boroughs said to her sister, as I overheard, but she did not design\n",
      "I should, What a sweet creature is this! and then she takes so little\n",
      "upon her, is so free, so easy, and owns the honour done her, so\n",
      "obligingly! said Mr. Perry, softly, The loveliest person I ever saw! Who\n",
      "could have the heart to be angry with her one moment?\n",
      "\n",
      "Says Miss Darnford, Here, my dearest neighbour, these gentry are\n",
      "admiring you strangely; and Mr. Perry says, you are the loveliest lady\n",
      "he ever saw; and he says it to his own mistress's face too, I'll assure\n",
      "you!--Or else, says Miss Boroughs, I should think he much flattered me.\n",
      "\n",
      "O, madam, you are exceedingly obliging! but your kind opinion ought to\n",
      "teach me humility, and to reverence so generous a worth as can give a\n",
      "preference against yourself, where it is so little due. Indeed, madam,\n",
      "said Miss Nanny Boroughs, I love my sister well; but it would be a high\n",
      "compliment to any lady, to be deemed worthy a second or third place\n",
      "after you.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no answering such politeness, said I: I am sure Lady Davers\n",
      "was very cruel to keep me from such company. 'Twas our loss, madam, says\n",
      "Miss Darnford. I'll allow it, said I, in degree; for you have all been\n",
      "deprived, several hours, of an humble admirer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Perry said, I never before saw so young a lady shine forth with such\n",
      "graces of mind and person. Alas! sir, said I, my master coming up, mine\n",
      "is but a borrowed shine, like that of the moon. Here is the sun, to\n",
      "whose fervent glow of generosity I owe all the faint lustre, that your\n",
      "goodness is pleased to look upon with so much kind distinction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Perry was pleased to hold up his hands; and the ladies looked upon\n",
      "one another. And my master said, hearing part of the last sentence,\n",
      "What's the pretty subject, that my Pamela is displaying so sweetly her\n",
      "talents upon?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh! sir, said Mr. Perry, I will pronounce you the happiest man in\n",
      "England: and so said they all.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master said, most generously, Thank ye, thank ye, thank ye, all\n",
      "round, my dear friends. I know not your subject; but if you believe\n",
      "me so, for a single instance of this dear girl's goodness, what must I\n",
      "think myself, when blessed with a thousand instances, and experiencing\n",
      "it in every single act and word! I do assure you my Pamela's person,\n",
      "all lovely as you see it, is far short of her mind: That, indeed,\n",
      "first attracted my admiration, and made me her lover: but they were\n",
      "the beauties of her mind, that made me her husband; and proud, my sweet\n",
      "dear, said he, pressing my hand, am I of that title.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said Mr. Perry, very kindly and politely, excellent as your lady\n",
      "is, I know not the gentleman that could deserve her, but that one who\n",
      "could say such just and such fine things.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was all abashed; and took Miss Darnford's hand, and said, Save me,\n",
      "dear miss, by your sweet example, from my rising pride. But could I\n",
      "deserve half these kind things, what a happy creature should I be! said\n",
      "Miss Darnford, You deserve them all, indeed you do.\n",
      "\n",
      "The greatest part of the company having sat down to loo, my master being\n",
      "pressed, said he would take one game at whist; but had rather be excused\n",
      "too, having been up all night: and I asked how his friend did? We'll\n",
      "talk of that, said he, another time; which, and his seriousness, made me\n",
      "fear the poor gentleman was dead, as it proved.\n",
      "\n",
      "We cast in, and Miss Boroughs and my master were together, and Mr. Perry\n",
      "and I; and I had all four honours the first time, and we were up at\n",
      "one deal. Said my master, An honourable hand, Pamela, should go with an\n",
      "honourable heart; but you'd not have been up, if a knave had not been\n",
      "one. Whist, sir, said Mr. Perry, you know, was a court game originally;\n",
      "and the knave, I suppose, signified always the prime minister.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tis well, said my master, if now there is but one knave in a court, out\n",
      "of four persons, take the court through.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king and queen, sir, said Mr. Perry, can do no wrong, you know. So\n",
      "there are two that must be good out of four; and the ace seems too plain\n",
      "a card to mean much hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "We compliment the king, said my master, in that manner; and 'tis well to\n",
      "do so, because there is something sacred in the character. But yet, if\n",
      "force of example be considered, it is going a great way; for certainly a\n",
      "good master makes a good servant, generally speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing, added he, I will say, in regard to the ace: I have always\n",
      "looked upon that plain and honest looking card in the light you do: and\n",
      "have considered whist as an English game in its original; which has made\n",
      "me fonder of it than of any other. For by the ace I have always thought\n",
      "the laws of the land denoted; and as the ace is above the king or queen,\n",
      "and wins them, I think the law should be thought so too; though, may be,\n",
      "I shall be deemed a Whig for my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall never play whist, said Mr. Perry, without thinking of this,\n",
      "and shall love the game the better for the thought; though I am no\n",
      "party-man. Nor I, said my master; for I think the distinctions of whig\n",
      "and tory odious; and love the one or the other only as they are honest\n",
      "and worthy men; and have never (nor never shall, hope) given a vote, but\n",
      "according to what I thought was for the public good, let either whig or\n",
      "tory propose it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish, sir, replied Mr. Perry, all gentlemen in your station would act\n",
      "so. If there was no undue influence, said my master, I am willing to\n",
      "think so well of all mankind, that I believe they generally would.\n",
      "\n",
      "But you see, said he, by my Pamela's hand, when all the court-cards\n",
      "get together, and are acted by one mind, the game is usually turned\n",
      "accordingly: Though now and then, too, it may be so circumstanced, that\n",
      "honours will do them no good, and they are forced to depend altogether\n",
      "upon tricks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought this way of talking prettier than the game itself. But I\n",
      "said, Though I have won the game, I hope I am no trickster. No, said my\n",
      "master, God forbid but court-cards should sometimes win with honour! But\n",
      "you see, for all that, your game is as much owing to the knave as the\n",
      "king; and you, my fair-one, lost no advantage, when it was put into your\n",
      "power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Else, sir, said I, I should not have done justice to my partner. You\n",
      "are certainly right, Pamela, replied he; though you thereby beat your\n",
      "husband. Sir, said I, you may be my partner next, and I must do justice,\n",
      "you know. Well, said he, always choose so worthy a friend, as chance has\n",
      "given you for a partner, and I shall never find fault with you, do what\n",
      "you will.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Perry said, You are very good to me, sir; and Miss Boroughs, I\n",
      "observed, seemed pleased with the compliment to her humble servant; by\n",
      "which I saw she esteemed him, as he appears to deserve. Dear sir! said\n",
      "I, how much better is this, than to be locked in by Lady Davers!\n",
      "\n",
      "The supper was brought in sooner on my account, because I had had no\n",
      "dinner; and there passed very agreeable compliments on the occasion.\n",
      "Lady Darnford would help me first, because I had so long fasted, as she\n",
      "said. Sir Simon would have placed himself next me: And my master said,\n",
      "He thought it was best, where there was an equal number of ladies and\n",
      "gentlemen, that they should sit, intermingled, that the gentlemen might\n",
      "be employed in helping and serving the ladies. Lady Darnford said,\n",
      "She hoped Sir Simon would not sit above any ladies at his own table\n",
      "especially. Well, said he, I shall sit over-against her, however, and\n",
      "that's as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dearest sir could not keep his eyes off me, and seemed generously\n",
      "delighted with all I did, and all I said; and every one was pleased to\n",
      "see his kind and affectionate behaviour to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Jones brought up the discourse about Lady Davers again; and my\n",
      "master said, I fear, Pamela, you have been hardly used, more than you'll\n",
      "say. I know my sister's passionate temper too well, to believe she could\n",
      "be over-civil to you, especially as it happened so unluckily that I was\n",
      "out. If, added he, she had no pique to you, my dear, yet what has passed\n",
      "between her and me, has so exasperated her, that I know she would have\n",
      "quarrelled with my horse, if she had thought I valued it, and nobody\n",
      "else was in her way. Dear sir, said I, don't say so of good Lady Davers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, my dear, said he, I know she came on purpose to quarrel; and had\n",
      "she not found herself under a very violent uneasiness, after what had\n",
      "passed between us, and my treatment of her lord's letter, she would\n",
      "not have offered to come near me. What sort of language had she for me,\n",
      "Pamela? O sir, very good, only her well-mannered brother, and such as\n",
      "that!\n",
      "\n",
      "Only, said he, 'tis taking up the attention of the company disagreeably,\n",
      "or I could tell you almost every word she said. Lady Jones wished to\n",
      "hear a further account of my lady's conduct, and most of the company\n",
      "joined with her, particularly Mrs. Peters; who said, that as they knew\n",
      "the story, and Lady Davers's temper, though she was very good in the\n",
      "main, they could wish to be so agreeably entertained, if he and I\n",
      "pleased; because they imagined I should have no difficulties after this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tell me, then, Pamela, said he, did she lift up her hand at you? Did\n",
      "she strike you? But I hope not! A little slap of the hand, said I, or\n",
      "so.--Insolent woman! She did not, I hope, offer to strike your face?\n",
      "Why, said I, I was a little saucy once or twice; and she would have\n",
      "given me a cuff on the ear, if her woman and Mrs. Jewkes had not\n",
      "interposed. Why did you not come out at the door? Because, said I,\n",
      "her ladyship sat in the chair against it, one while, and another while\n",
      "locked it; else I offered several times to get away.\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew I expected you here: You say, you shewed her my letter to\n",
      "you? Yes, sir, said I; but I had better not; for she as then more\n",
      "exasperated, and made strange comments upon it. I doubt it not, said he;\n",
      "but, did she not see, by the kind epithets in it, that there was no room\n",
      "to doubt of our being married? O, sir, replied I, and made the company\n",
      "smile, she said, For that very reason she was sure I was not married.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's like my sister! said he; exactly like her; and yet she lives\n",
      "very happily herself: for her poor lord never contradicts her. Indeed he\n",
      "dares not.\n",
      "\n",
      "You were a great many wenches, were you not, my dear? for that's a great\n",
      "word with her.--Yes, sir, said I, wenches and creatures out of number;\n",
      "and worse than all that. What? tell me, my dear. Sir, said I, I must not\n",
      "have you angry with Lady Davers; while you are so good to me, 'tis all\n",
      "nothing; only the trouble I have that I cannot be suffered to shew how\n",
      "much I honoured her ladyship, as your sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said he, you need not be afraid to tell me: I must love her after\n",
      "all; though I shall not be pleased with her on this occasion. I know\n",
      "it is her love for me, though thus oddly expressed, that makes her so\n",
      "uneasy: and, after all, she comes, I'm sure, to be reconciled to me;\n",
      "though it must be through a good hearty quarrel first: for she can shew\n",
      "a good deal of sunshine; but it must be always after a storm; and I'll\n",
      "love her dearly, if she has not been, and will not be, too hard upon my\n",
      "dearest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Peters said, Sir, you are very good, and very kind; I love to see\n",
      "this complaisance to your sister, though she be in fault, so long as you\n",
      "can shew it with so much justice to the sweetest innocence and merit\n",
      "in the world. By all that's good, Mr. Peters, said he, I'd present my\n",
      "sister with a thousand pounds, if she would kindly take my dear Pamela\n",
      "by the hand, and wish her joy, and call her sister!--And yet I should be\n",
      "unworthy of the dear creature that smiles upon me there, if it was not\n",
      "principally for her sake, and the pleasure it would give her, that I say\n",
      "this: for I will never be thoroughly reconciled to my sister till she\n",
      "does; for I most sincerely think, as to myself, that my dear wife, there\n",
      "she sits, does me more honour in her new relation, than she receives\n",
      "from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, I am overwhelmed with your goodness!--And my eyes were\n",
      "filled with tears of joy and gratitude: and all the company with one\n",
      "voice blessed him. And Lady Jones was pleased to say, The behaviour of\n",
      "you two happy ones, to each other, is the most edifying I ever knew. I\n",
      "am always improved when I see you. How happy would every good lady be\n",
      "with such a gentleman, and every good gentleman with such a lady!--In\n",
      "short, you seem made for one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "O madam, said I, you are so kind, so good to me, that I know not how to\n",
      "thank you enough!--Said she, You deserve more than I can express; for,\n",
      "to all that know your story, you are a matchless person. You are an\n",
      "ornament to our sex and your virtue, though Mr. B---- is so generous\n",
      "as he is, has met with no more than its due reward. God long bless you\n",
      "together!\n",
      "\n",
      "You are, said my dearest sir, very good to me, madam, I am sure. I have\n",
      "taken liberties in my former life, that deserved not so much excellence.\n",
      "I have offended extremely, by trials glorious to my Pamela, but\n",
      "disgraceful to me, against a virtue that I now consider as almost\n",
      "sacred; and I shall not think I deserve her, till I can bring my\n",
      "manners, my sentiments, and my actions, to a conformity with her own.\n",
      "In short, my Pamela, continued he, I want you to be nothing but what you\n",
      "are, and have been. You cannot be better; and if you could, it would\n",
      "be but filling me with despair to attain the awful heights of virtue at\n",
      "which you have arrived. Perhaps, added the dear gentleman, the scene\n",
      "I have beheld within these twelve hours, has made me more serious than\n",
      "otherwise I should have been: but I'll assure you, before all this good\n",
      "company, I speak the sentiments of my heart, and those not of this day\n",
      "only.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a happy daughter is yours, O my dear father and mother! I owe it\n",
      "all to God's grace, and to yours and my good lady's instructions: And to\n",
      "these let me always look back with grateful acknowledgments, that I may\n",
      "not impute to myself, and be proud, my inexpressible happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company were so kindly pleased with our concern, and my dear\n",
      "master's goodness, that he, observing their indulgence, and being\n",
      "himself curious to know the further particulars of what had passed\n",
      "between my lady and me, repeated his question, What she had called me\n",
      "besides wench and creature? And I said, My lady, supposing I was wicked,\n",
      "lamented over me, very kindly, my depravity and fall, and said, What a\n",
      "thousand pities it was, so much virtue, as she was pleased to say, was\n",
      "so destroyed; and that I had yielded, after so noble a stand! as she\n",
      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excuse me, gentlemen and ladies, said I! you know my story, it seems;\n",
      "and I am commanded, by one who has a title to all my obedience, to\n",
      "proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "They gave all of them bows of approbation, that they might not interrupt\n",
      "me; and I continued my story--the men-servants withdrawing, at a motion\n",
      "of Mr. B----, on my looking towards them: and then, at Lady Darnford's\n",
      "coming in, I proceeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told her ladyship, that I was still innocent, and would be so, and\n",
      "it was injurious to suppose me otherwise. Why, tell me, wench, said\n",
      "she--But I think I must not tell you what she said. Yes, do, said my\n",
      "master, to clear my sister; we shall think it very bad else.\n",
      "\n",
      "I held my hand before my face--Why, she said, Tell me, wench, hast thou\n",
      "not been--hesitating--a very free creature with thy master? That she\n",
      "said, or to that effect--And when I said, She asked strange questions,\n",
      "and in strange words, she ridiculed my delicacy, as she called it; and\n",
      "said, My niceness would not last long. She said, I must know I was not\n",
      "really married, that my ring was only a sham, and all was my cunning to\n",
      "cloak my yielding, and get better terms. She said, She knew the world as\n",
      "much at thirty-two, as I did at sixteen; and bid me remember that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the liberty to say, (but I got a good way off,) that I scorned\n",
      "her ladyship's words, and was as much married as her ladyship. And then\n",
      "I had certainly been cuffed, if her woman had not interposed, and told\n",
      "her I was not worthy her anger; and that I was as much to be pitied for\n",
      "my credulity, as despised for my vanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "My poor Pamela, said my master, this was too, too hard upon you! O sir,\n",
      "said I, how much easier it was to me than if it had been so!--That would\n",
      "have broken my heart quite!--For then I should have deserved it all, and\n",
      "worse; and these reproaches, added to my own guilt, would have made me\n",
      "truly wretched!\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Darnford, at whose right-hand I sat, kissed me with a kind of\n",
      "rapture, and called me a sweet exemplar for all my sex. Mr. Peters said\n",
      "very handsome things; so did Mr. Perry and Sir Simon, with tears in his\n",
      "eyes, said to my master, Why, neighbour, neighbour, this is excellent,\n",
      "by my troth. I believe there is something in virtue, that we had not\n",
      "well considered. On my soul, there has been but one angel come down for\n",
      "these thousand years, and you have got her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, my dearest, said my master, pray proceed with your story until, we\n",
      "have done supper, since the ladies seem pleased with it. Why, sir, said\n",
      "I, her ladyship went on in the same manner; but said, one time, (and\n",
      "held me by the hand,) she would give me an hundred guineas for one\n",
      "provoking word; or, if I would but say I believed myself married, that\n",
      "she might fell me at her foot: But, sir, you must not be angry with her\n",
      "ladyship. She called me painted dirt, baby-face, waiting-maid, beggar's\n",
      "brat, and beggar-born; but I said, As long as I knew my innocence, I was\n",
      "easy in every thing, but to have my dear parents abused. They were never\n",
      "beggars, nor beholden to any body; nor to any thing but God's grace and\n",
      "their own labour; that they once lived in credit; that misfortunes might\n",
      "befall any body; and that I could not bear they should be treated so\n",
      "undeservedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then her ladyship said, Ay, she supposed my master's folly would make\n",
      "us set up for a family, and that the heralds' office would shortly be\n",
      "searched to make it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly my sister again! said he. So you could not please her any way?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, indeed, sir. When she commanded me to fill her a glass of wine,\n",
      "and would not let her woman do it, she asked, If I was above it? I then\n",
      "said, If to attend your ladyship at table, or even kneel at your feet,\n",
      "was required of me, I would most gladly do it, were I only the person\n",
      "you think me. But if it be to triumph over one, who has received honours\n",
      "which she thinks require from her another part, that she may not\n",
      "be utterly unworthy of them, I must say, I cannot do it. This quite\n",
      "astonished her ladyship; and a little before, her kinsman brought me\n",
      "the bottle and glass, and required me to fill it for my lady, at her\n",
      "command, and called himself my deputy: And I said, 'Tis in a good hand;\n",
      "help my lady yourself. So, sir, added I, you see I could be a little\n",
      "saucy upon occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "You please me well, my Pamela, said he. This was quite right. But\n",
      "proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her ladyship said, She was astonished! adding, She supposed I would have\n",
      "her look upon me as her brother's wife: And asked me, What, in the name\n",
      "of impudence, possessed me, to dare to look upon myself as her sister?\n",
      "And I said, That was a question better became her most worthy brother to\n",
      "answer, than me. And then I thought I should have had her ladyship upon\n",
      "me; but her woman interposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I afterwards told Mrs. Jewkes, at the window, that since I was hindered\n",
      "from going to you, I believed it was best to let Robert go with the\n",
      "chariot, and say, Lady Davers was come, and I could not leave her\n",
      "ladyship. But this did not please; and I thought it would too; for she\n",
      "said, No, no, he'll think I make the creature my companion, and know not\n",
      "how to part with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly, said he, my sister again.\n",
      "\n",
      "And she said, I knew nothing what belonged to people of condition; how\n",
      "should I?--What shall I say, madam? said I. Nothing at all, answered\n",
      "she; let him expect his dearest love, alluding to your kind epithet in\n",
      "your letter, and be disappointed; it is but adding a few more hours\n",
      "to this heavy absence, and every one will become a day in his amorous\n",
      "account.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to be short, I saw nothing was to be done; and I feared, sir, you\n",
      "would wonder at my stay, and be angry; and I watched my opportunity,\n",
      "till my lady, who was walking about the room, was at the further end;\n",
      "and the parlour being a ground-floor, in a manner, I jumped out at the\n",
      "window, and ran for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her ladyship called after me; so did her woman; and I heard her say, I\n",
      "flew like a bird; and she called two of her servants in sight to stop\n",
      "me; but I said, Touch me at your peril, fellows! And Mr. Colbrand,\n",
      "having been planted at hand by Mrs. Jewkes, (who was very good in the\n",
      "whole affair, and incurred her ladyship's displeasure, once or twice, by\n",
      "taking my part,) seeing how I was used, put on a fierce look, cocked\n",
      "his hat with one hand, and put t'other on his sword, and said, he would\n",
      "chine the man who offered to touch his lady. And so he ran alongside\n",
      "of me, and could hardly keep pace with me:--And here, my dear sir,\n",
      "concluded I, I am, at yours and the good company's service.\n",
      "\n",
      "They seemed highly pleased with my relation; and my master said, he was\n",
      "glad Mrs. Jewkes behaved so well, as also Mr. Colbrand. Yes, sir, said\n",
      "I: when Mrs. Jewkes interposed once, her ladyship said, It was hard,\n",
      "she, who was born in that house, could not have some privilege in\n",
      "it, without being talked to by the saucy servants. And she called her\n",
      "another time fat-face, and womaned her most violently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said my master, I am glad, my dear, you have had such an escape.\n",
      "My sister was always passionate, as Mrs. Peters knows: And my poor\n",
      "mother had enough to do with us both. For we neither of us wanted\n",
      "spirit: and when I was a boy, I never came home from school or college\n",
      "for a few days, but though we longed to see one another before, yet ere\n",
      "the first day was over, we had a quarrel; for she, being seven years\n",
      "older than I, was always for domineering over me, and I could not bear\n",
      "it. And I used, on her frequently quarrelling with the maids, and being\n",
      "always at a word and a blow, to call her Captain Bab; for her name is\n",
      "Barbara. And when my Lord Davers courted her, my poor mother has made up\n",
      "quarrels between them three times in a day; and I used to tell her, she\n",
      "would certainly beat her husband, marry whom she would, if he did not\n",
      "beat her first, and break her spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet has she, continued he, very good qualities. She was a dutiful\n",
      "daughter, is a good wife; she is bountiful to her servants, firm in her\n",
      "friendships, charitable to the poor, and, I believe, never any sister\n",
      "better loved a brother, than she me: and yet she always loved to vex and\n",
      "tease me; and as I would bear a resentment longer than she, she'd be one\n",
      "moment the most provoking creature in the world, and the next would\n",
      "do any thing to be forgiven; and I have made her, when she was the\n",
      "aggressor, follow me all over the house and garden to be upon good terms\n",
      "with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this case piques her more, because she had found out a match for\n",
      "me in the family of a person of quality, and had set her heart upon\n",
      "bringing it to effect, and had even proceeded far in it, without my\n",
      "knowledge, and brought me into the lady's company, unknowing of her\n",
      "design. But I was then averse to matrimony upon any terms; and was angry\n",
      "at her proceeding in it so far without my privity or encouragement: And\n",
      "she cannot, for this reason, bear the thoughts of my being now married,\n",
      "and to her mother's waiting-maid too, as she reminds my dear Pamela,\n",
      "when I had declined her proposal with the daughter of a noble earl.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the whole case, said he; and, allowing for the pride\n",
      "and violence of her spirit, and that she knows not, as I do, the\n",
      "transcendent excellencies of my dear Pamela, and that all her view, in\n",
      "her own conception, is mine and the family honour, she is a little to be\n",
      "allowed for: Though, never fear, my Pamela, but that I, who never had\n",
      "a struggle with her, wherein I did not get the better, will do you\n",
      "justice, and myself too.\n",
      "\n",
      "This account of Lady Davers pleased every body, and was far from being\n",
      "to her ladyship's disadvantage in the main; and I would do any thing\n",
      "in the world to have the honour to be in her good graces: Yet I fear it\n",
      "will not be easily, if at all, effected. But I will proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "After supper, nothing would serve Miss Darnford and Miss Boroughs, but\n",
      "we must have a dance; and Mr. Peters, who plays a good fiddle, urged\n",
      "it forward. My dear master, though in a riding-dress, took out Miss\n",
      "Boroughs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Simon, for a man of his years, danced well, and took me out; but put\n",
      "on one of his free jokes, that I was fitter to dance with a younger\n",
      "man; and he would have it, (though I had not danced since my dear lady's\n",
      "death to signify, except once or twice to please Mrs. Jervis, and,\n",
      "indeed, believed all my dancing days over,) that as my master and I were\n",
      "the best dancers, we should dance once together, before folks, as the\n",
      "odd gentleman said; and my dear sir was pleased to oblige him: And\n",
      "afterwards danced with Miss Darnford, who has much more skill and\n",
      "judgment than I; though they compliment me with an easier shape and air.\n",
      "\n",
      "We left the company with great difficulty at about eleven, my dear\n",
      "master having been up all night before, and we being at the greatest\n",
      "distance from home; though they seemed inclinable not to break up so\n",
      "soon, as they were neighbours; and the ladies said, They longed to hear\n",
      "what would be the end of Lady Davers's interview with her brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master said, He feared we must not now think of going next day to\n",
      "Bedfordshire, as we had intended; and perhaps might see them again. And\n",
      "so we took leave, and set out for home; where we arrived not till twelve\n",
      "o'clock; and found Lady Davers had gone to bed about eleven, wanting\n",
      "sadly that we should come home first; but so did not I.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes told us, That my lady was sadly fretted that I had got away\n",
      "so; and seemed a little apprehensive of what I would say of the usage\n",
      "I had received from her. She asked Mrs. Jewkes, if she thought I\n",
      "was really married? And Mrs. Jewkes telling her yes, she fell into a\n",
      "passion, and said, Begone, bold woman, I cannot bear thee! See not my\n",
      "face till I send for thee! Thou hast been very impudent to me once or\n",
      "twice to-day already, and art now worse than ever. She said, She would\n",
      "not have told her ladyship, if she had not asked her; and was sorry she\n",
      "had offended.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sent for her at supper time: Said she, I have another question to\n",
      "ask thee, woman, and tell me yes, if thou darest. Was ever any thing so\n",
      "odd?--Why then, said Mrs. Jewkes, I will say No, before your ladyship\n",
      "speaks.--My master laughed: Poor woman! said he.--She called her\n",
      "insolent, and assurance; and said, Begone, bold woman as thou art!--but\n",
      "come hither. Dost thou know if that young harlot is to be with my\n",
      "brother to-night?\n",
      "\n",
      "She said she knew not what to answer, because she had threatened her if\n",
      "she said yes. But at last my lady said, I will know the bottom of this\n",
      "iniquity. I suppose they won't have so much impudence to be together\n",
      "while I'm in the house; but I dare say they have been bed-fellows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said she, I will lie to-night in the room I was born in; so get that\n",
      "bed ready. That room being our bedchamber, Mrs. Jewkes, after some\n",
      "hesitation, replied, Madam, my master lies there, and has the key. I\n",
      "believe, woman, said she, thou tellest me a story. Indeed, madam, said\n",
      "she, he does; and has some papers there he will let nobody see; for Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes said, she feared she would beat her if she went up, and found by\n",
      "my clothes, and some of my master's, how it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she said, I will then lie in the best room, as it is called; and\n",
      "Jackey shall lie in the little green room adjoining to it. Has thy\n",
      "master got the keys of those?--No, madam, said Mrs. Jewkes: I will order\n",
      "them to be made ready for your ladyship.\n",
      "\n",
      "And where dost thou lay the pursy sides? said she. Up two pair of\n",
      "stairs, madam, next the garden. And where lies the young harlotry?\n",
      "continued she. Sometimes with me, madam, said she. And sometimes with\n",
      "thy virtuous master, I suppose? said my lady.--Ha, woman! what sayest\n",
      "thou? I must not speak, said Mrs. Jewkes. Well, thou mayest go, said\n",
      "she; but thou hast the air of a secret keeper of that sort I dare say\n",
      "thoul't set the good work forward most cordially. Poor Mrs. Jewkes, said\n",
      "my master, and laughed most heartily.\n",
      "\n",
      "This talk we had whilst we were undressing. So she and her woman lay\n",
      "together in the room my master lay in before I was happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, Dear sir, pray, in the morning let me lock myself up in the\n",
      "closet, as soon as you rise; and not be called down for ever so much;\n",
      "for I am afraid to see her ladyship: And I will employ myself about my\n",
      "journal, while these things are in my head. Don't be afraid, my dear,\n",
      "said he: Am not I with you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes pitied me for what I had undergone in the day; and I said,\n",
      "We won't make the worst of it to my dear master, because we won't\n",
      "exasperate where we would reconcile: but, added I, I am much obliged to\n",
      "you, Mrs. Jewkes, and I thank you. Said my master, I hope she did not\n",
      "beat your lady, Mrs. Jewkes? Not much, sir, said she; but I believe I\n",
      "saved my lady once: Yet, added she, I was most vexed at the young\n",
      "lord. Ay, Mrs. Jewkes, said my master, let me know his behaviour. I\n",
      "can chastise him, though I cannot my sister, who is a woman; let me\n",
      "therefore know the part he acted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing, my dear sir, said I, but impertinence, if I may so say, and\n",
      "foolishness, that was very provoking; but I spared him not; and so there\n",
      "is no room, sir, for your anger. No, sir, said Mrs. Jewkes, nothing else\n",
      "indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "How was her woman? said my master. Pretty impertinent, replied Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes, as ladies' women will be. But, said I, you know she saved me\n",
      "once or twice. Very true, madam, returned Mrs. Jewkes. And she said to\n",
      "me at table, that you were a sweet creature; she never saw your equal;\n",
      "but that you had a spirit; and she was sorry you answered her lady so,\n",
      "who never bore so much contradiction before. I told her, added Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes, that if I was in your ladyship's place, I should have taken much\n",
      "more upon me, and that you were all sweetness. And she said, I was got\n",
      "over, she saw.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuesday morning, the sixth of my happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master had said to Mrs. Jewkes, that he should not rise till eight\n",
      "or nine, as he had sat up all the night before: but it seems, my lady,\n",
      "knowing he usually rose about six, got up soon after that hour; raised\n",
      "her woman and her nephew; having a whimsical scheme in her head, to try\n",
      "to find whether we were in bed together: And, about half an hour after\n",
      "six, she rapped at our chamber door.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master was waked at the noise, and asked, Who was there? Open the\n",
      "door, said she; open it this minute! I said, clinging about his neck,\n",
      "Dear, dear sir, pray, pray don't!--O save me, save me! Don't fear,\n",
      "Pamela, said he. The woman's mad, I believe.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he called out; Who are you? What do you want?--You know my voice\n",
      "well enough, said she:--I will come in.--Pray, sir, said I, don't let\n",
      "her ladyship in.--Don't be frightened, my dear, said he; she thinks we\n",
      "are not married, and are afraid to be found a-bed together. I'll let her\n",
      "in; but she shan't come near my dearest.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he slipt out of bed, and putting on some of his clothes, and gown\n",
      "and slippers, he said, What bold body dare disturb my repose thus? and\n",
      "opened the door. In rushed she: I'll see your wickedness, said she, I\n",
      "will! In vain shall you think to hide it from me.--What should I hide?\n",
      "said he. How dare you set a foot into my house, after the usage I\n",
      "have received from you?--I had covered myself over head and ears, and\n",
      "trembled every joint. He looked, and 'spied her woman and kinsman in\n",
      "the room, she crying out, Bear witness, Jackey; bear witness, Beck; the\n",
      "creature is now in his bed! And not seeing the young gentleman before,\n",
      "who was at the feet of the bed, he said, How now, sir? What's your\n",
      "business in this apartment? Begone this moment!--And he went away\n",
      "directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beck, said my lady, you see the creature is in his bed. I do, madam,\n",
      "answered she. My master came to me, and said, Ay, look, Beck, and bear\n",
      "witness: Here is my Pamela!--My dear angel, my lovely creature, don't be\n",
      "afraid; look up, and see how frantickly this woman of quality behaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that, I just peeped, and saw my lady, who could not bear this, coming\n",
      "to me; and she said, Wicked abandoned wretch! Vile brother, to brave me\n",
      "thus! I'll tear the creature out of bed before your face, and expose you\n",
      "both as you deserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that he took her in his arms, as if she had been nothing; and\n",
      "carrying her out of the room, she cried out, Beck! Beck! help me, Beck!\n",
      "the wretch is going to fling me down stairs! Her woman ran to him,\n",
      "and said, Good sir, for Heaven's sake do no violence to my lady! Her\n",
      "ladyship has been ill all night.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat her down in the chamber she lay in, and she could not speak for\n",
      "passion. Take care of your lady, said he; and when she has rendered\n",
      "herself more worthy of my attention, I'll see her; till then, at her\n",
      "peril, and yours too, come not near my apartment. And so he came to me,\n",
      "and, with all the sweet soothing words in the world, pacified my fears,\n",
      "and gave me leave to go to write in my closet, as soon as my fright was\n",
      "over, and to stay there till things were more calm. And so he dressed\n",
      "himself, and went out of the chamber, permitting me, at my desire, to\n",
      "fasten the door after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "At breakfast-time my master tapped at the door, and I said, Who's\n",
      "there? I, my dearest, said he. Oh! then, replied I, I will open it with\n",
      "pleasure. I had written on a good deal; but I put it by, when I ran to\n",
      "the door. I would have locked it again, when he was in; but he said, Am\n",
      "not I here? Don't be afraid. Said he, Will you come down to breakfast,\n",
      "my love? O no, dear sir, said I; be pleased to excuse me! said he,\n",
      "I cannot bear the look of it, that the mistress of my house should\n",
      "breakfast in her closet, as if she durst not come down, and I at\n",
      "home!--O, dearest sir, replied I, pray pass that over, for my sake; and\n",
      "don't let my presence aggravate your sister, for a kind punctilio! Then,\n",
      "my dear, said he, I will breakfast with you here. No, pray, dear sir,\n",
      "answered I, breakfast with your sister. That, my dear, replied he, will\n",
      "too much gratify her pride, and look like a slight to you.--Dear sir,\n",
      "said I, your goodness is too great, for me to want punctilious proofs of\n",
      "it. Pray oblige her ladyship. She is your guest surely, sir, you may be\n",
      "freest with your dutiful wife!\n",
      "\n",
      "She is a strange woman, said he: How I pity her!--She has thrown herself\n",
      "into a violent fit of the colic, through passion: And is but now, her\n",
      "woman says, a little easier. I hope, sir, said I, when you carried her\n",
      "ladyship out, you did not hurt her. No, replied he, I love her too well.\n",
      "I set her down in the apartment she had chosen: and she but now desires\n",
      "to see me, and that I will breakfast with her, or refuses to touch any\n",
      "thing. But, if my dearest please, I will insist it shall be with you at\n",
      "the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "O, no, no, dear sir! said I; I should not forgive myself, if I did. I\n",
      "would on my knees beg her ladyship's goodness to me, now I am in your\n",
      "presence; though I thought I ought to carry it a little stiff when you\n",
      "were absent, for the sake of the honour you have done me. And, dear sir,\n",
      "if my deepest humility will please, permit me to shew it.\n",
      "\n",
      "You shall do nothing, returned he, unworthy of my wife, to please the\n",
      "proud woman!--But I will, however, permit you to breakfast by yourself\n",
      "this once, as I have not seen her since I have used her in so barbarous\n",
      "a manner, as I understand she exclaims I have; and as she will not\n",
      "eat any thing, unless I give her my company.--So he saluted me, and\n",
      "withdrew; and I locked the door after him again for fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes soon after rapped at the door. Who's there? said I. Only\n",
      "I, madam. So I opened the door. 'Tis a sad thing, madam, said she,\n",
      "you should be so much afraid in your own house. She brought me some\n",
      "chocolate and toast; and I asked her about my lady's behaviour. She\n",
      "said, she would not suffer any body to attend but her woman, because she\n",
      "would not be heard what she had to say; but she believed, she said, her\n",
      "master was very angry with the young lord, as she called her kinsman;\n",
      "for, as she passed by the door, she heard him say, in a high tone, I\n",
      "hope, sir, you did not forget what belongs to the character you assume;\n",
      "or to that effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "About one o'clock my master came up again, and he said, Will you come\n",
      "down to dinner, Pamela, when I send for you? Whatever you command, sir,\n",
      "I must do. But my lady won't desire to see me. No matter whether she\n",
      "will or no. But I will not suffer, that she shall prescribe her insolent\n",
      "will to my wife, and in your own house too.--I will, by my tenderness to\n",
      "you, mortify her pride; and it cannot be done so well as to her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dearest sir, said I, pray indulge me, and let me dine here by myself. It\n",
      "will make my lady but more inveterate.--Said he, I have told her we are\n",
      "married. She is out of all patience about it, and yet pretends not to\n",
      "believe it. Upon that I tell her, Then she shall have it her own way,\n",
      "and that I am not. And what has she to do with it either way? She has\n",
      "scolded and begged, commanded and prayed, blessed me, and cursed me,\n",
      "by turns, twenty times in these few hours. And I have sometimes soothed\n",
      "her, sometimes raged; and at last left her, and took a turn in the\n",
      "garden for an hour to compose myself, because you should not see how the\n",
      "foolish woman has ruffled me; and just now I came out, seeing her coming\n",
      "in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as he had said so, I cried, Oh! my lady, my lady! for I heard\n",
      "her voice in the chamber, saying, Brother, brother, one word with\n",
      "you--stopping in sight of the closet where I was. He stepped out, and\n",
      "she went up to the window that looks towards the garden, and said, Mean\n",
      "fool that I am, to follow you up and down the house in this manner,\n",
      "though I am shunned and avoided by you! You a brother!--You a barbarian!\n",
      "Is it possible we could be born of one mother?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, said he, do you charge me with a conduct to you, that you bring\n",
      "upon yourself?--Is it not surprising that you should take the liberty\n",
      "with me, that the dear mother you have named never gave you an example\n",
      "for to any of her relations?--Was it not sufficient, that I was\n",
      "insolently taken to task by you in your letters, but my retirements must\n",
      "be invaded? My house insulted? And, if I have one person dearer to me\n",
      "than another, that that person must be singled out for an object of your\n",
      "violence?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ay, said she, that one person is the thing!--But though I came with a\n",
      "resolution to be temperate, and to expostulate with you on your avoiding\n",
      "me so unkindly, yet cannot I have patience to look upon that bed in\n",
      "which I was born, and to be made the guilty scene of your wickedness\n",
      "with such a----\n",
      "\n",
      "Hush! said he, I charge you! call not the dear girl by any name unworthy\n",
      "of her. You know not, as I told you, her excellence; and I desire you'll\n",
      "not repeat the freedoms you have taken below.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stamped with her foot, and said, God give me patience! So much\n",
      "contempt to a sister that loves you so well; and so much tenderness to a\n",
      "vile----\n",
      "\n",
      "He put his hand before her mouth: Be silent, said he, once more, I\n",
      "charge you! You know not the innocence you abuse so freely. I ought not,\n",
      "neither will I bear it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat down and fanned herself, and burst into tears, and such sobs\n",
      "of grief, or rather passion, that grieved me to hear; and I sat and\n",
      "trembled sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked about the room in great anger; and at last said, Let me ask\n",
      "you, Lady Davers, why I am thus insolently to be called to account\n",
      "by you? Am I not independent? Am I not of age? Am I not at liberty to\n",
      "please myself?--Would to God, that, instead of a woman, and my sister,\n",
      "any man breathing had dared, whatever were his relation under that of\n",
      "a father, to give himself half the airs you have done!--Why did you not\n",
      "send on this accursed errand your lord, who could write me such a letter\n",
      "as no gentleman should write, nor any gentleman tamely receive? He\n",
      "should have seen the difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all know, said she, that, since your Italian duel, you have commenced\n",
      "a bravo; and all your airs breathe as strongly of the manslayer as of\n",
      "the libertine. This, said he, I will bear; for I have no reason to\n",
      "be ashamed of that duel, nor the cause of it; since it was to save a\n",
      "friend, and because it is levelled at myself only: but suffer not your\n",
      "tongue to take too great a liberty with my Pamela.\n",
      "\n",
      "She interrupted him in a violent burst of passion. If I bear this, said\n",
      "she, I can bear any thing!--O the little strumpet!--He interrupted her\n",
      "then, and said wrathfully, Begone, rageful woman! begone this moment\n",
      "from my presence! Leave my house this instant!--I renounce you, and\n",
      "all relation to you! and never more let me see your face, or call me\n",
      "brother! And took her by the hand to lead her out. She laid hold of the\n",
      "curtains of the window, and said, I will not go! You shall not force me\n",
      "from you thus ignominiously in the wretch's hearing, and suffer her to\n",
      "triumph over me in your barbarous treatment of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not considering any thing, I ran out of the closet, and threw myself at\n",
      "my dear master's feet, as he held her hand, in order to lead her out;\n",
      "and I said, Dearest sir, let me beg, that no act of unkindness, for my\n",
      "sake, pass between so worthy and so near relations. Dear, dear madam,\n",
      "said I, and clasped her knees, pardon and excuse the unhappy cause of\n",
      "all this evil; on my knees I beg your ladyship to receive me to your\n",
      "grace and favour, and you shall find me incapable of any triumph but in\n",
      "your ladyship's goodness to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Creature, said she, art thou to beg an excuse for me?--Art thou to\n",
      "implore my forgiveness? Is it to thee I am to owe the favour, that I\n",
      "am not cast headlong from my brother's presence? Begone to thy corner,\n",
      "wench! begone, I say, lest thy paramour kill me for trampling thee under\n",
      "my foot!\n",
      "\n",
      "Rise, my dear Pamela, said my master; rise, dear life of my life; and\n",
      "expose not so much worthiness to the ungrateful scorn of so violent a\n",
      "spirit. And so he led me to my closet again, and there I sat and wept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her woman came up, just as he had led me to my closet, and was returning\n",
      "to her lady; and she very humbly said, Excuse my intrusion, good sir!--I\n",
      "hope I may come to my lady. Yes, Mrs. Worden, said he, you may come in;\n",
      "and pray take your lady down stairs with you, for fear I should too much\n",
      "forget what belongs either to my sister or myself!\n",
      "\n",
      "I began to think (seeing her ladyship so outrageous with her brother)\n",
      "what a happy escape I had had the day before, though hardly enough used\n",
      "in conscience too, as I thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her woman begged her ladyship to walk down; and she said, Beck, seest\n",
      "thou that bed? That was the bed that I was born in; and yet that was the\n",
      "bed thou sawest, as well as I, the wicked Pamela in, this morning, and\n",
      "this brother of mine just risen from her!\n",
      "\n",
      "True, said he; you both saw it, and it is my pride that you could see\n",
      "it. 'Tis my bridal bed; and 'tis abominable that the happiness I knew\n",
      "before you came hither, should be so barbarously interrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swear to me but, thou bold wretch! said she, swear to me, that Pamela\n",
      "Andrews is really and truly thy lawful wife, without sham, without\n",
      "deceit, without double-meaning; and I know what I have to say!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll humour you for once, said he; and then swore a solemn oath that I\n",
      "was. And, said he, did I not tell you so at first?\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot yet believe you, said she; because, in this particular, I had\n",
      "rather have called you knave than fool.--Provoke me not too much, said\n",
      "he; for, if I should as much forget myself as you have done, you'd have\n",
      "no more of a brother in me, than I have a sister in you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who married you? said she: tell me that! Was it not a broken attorney\n",
      "in a parson's habit? Tell me truly, in the wench's hearing. When she's\n",
      "undeceived, she'll know how to behave herself better! Thank God, thought\n",
      "I, it is not so.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, said he; and I'll tell you, that I bless God, I abhorred that\n",
      "project, before it was brought to bear: and Mr. Williams married\n",
      "us.--Nay then, said she--but answer me another question or two, I\n",
      "beseech you: Who gave her away? Parson Peters, said he. Where was the\n",
      "ceremony performed? In my little chapel, which you may see, as it was\n",
      "put in order on purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, said she, I begin to fear there is something in it! But who was\n",
      "present? said she. Methinks, replied he, I look like a fine puppy, to\n",
      "suffer myself to be thus interrogated by an insolent sister: but, if\n",
      "you must know, Mrs. Jewkes was present. O the procuress! said she: But\n",
      "nobody else? Yes, said he, all my heart and soul!\n",
      "\n",
      "Wretch! said she; and what would thy father and mother have said,\n",
      "had they lived to this day? Their consents, replied he, I should have\n",
      "thought it my duty to ask; but not yours, madam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose, said she, I had married my father's groom! what would you have\n",
      "said to that?--I could not have behaved worse, replied he, than you have\n",
      "done. And would you not have thought, said she, I had deserved it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said he, Does your pride let you see no difference in the case you put?\n",
      "None at all, said she. Where can the difference be between a beggar's\n",
      "son married by a lady, or a beggar's daughter made a gentleman's wife?\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I'll tell you, replied he; the difference is, a man ennobles the\n",
      "woman he takes, be she who she will; and adopts her into his own rank,\n",
      "be it what it will: but a woman, though ever so nobly born, debases\n",
      "herself by a mean marriage, and descends from her own rank to his she\n",

      "just then returned: Why, madam, said he, your ladyship won't go till you\n",
      "have dined, I hope. No, Jackey, said she, I can't stay; I'm an intruder\n",
      "here, it seems!--Think, said my master, of the occasion you gave for\n",
      "that word. Your violent passions are the only intruders! Lay them aside,\n",
      "and never sister was dearer to a brother. Don't say such another word,\n",
      "said she, I beseech you; for I am too easy to forgive you any thing for\n",
      "one kind word!--You shall have one hundred, said he, nay, ten thousand,\n",
      "if they will do, my dear sister. And, kissing her, he added, Pray give\n",
      "me your hand. John, said he, put up the horses; you are all as welcome\n",
      "to me, for all your lady's angry with me, as at any inn you can put up\n",
      "at. Come, Mr. H----, said he, lead your aunt in; for she won't permit\n",
      "that honour to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "This quite overcame her; and she said, giving her brother her hand,\n",
      "Yes, I will, and you shall lead me any where! and kissed him. But don't\n",
      "think, said she, I can forgive you neither. And so he led her into the\n",
      "parlour where I was. But, said she, why do you lead me to this wench?\n",
      "'Tis my wife, my dear sister; and if you will not love her, yet don't\n",
      "forget common civilities to her, for your own sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pray, madam, said her kinsman, since your brother is pleased to own his\n",
      "marriage, we must not forget common civilities, as Mr. B---- says. And,\n",
      "sir, added he, permit me to wish you joy. Thank you, sir, said he.\n",
      "And may I? said he, looking at me. Yes, sir, replied my master. So he\n",
      "saluted me, very complaisantly; and said, I vow to Gad, madam, I did not\n",
      "know this yesterday; and if I was guilty of a fault, I beg your pardon.\n",
      "\n",
      "My lady said, Thou'rt a good-natured foolish fellow; thou might'st have\n",
      "saved this nonsensical parade, till I had given thee leave. Why, aunt,\n",
      "said he, if they are actually married, there's no help for it; and we\n",
      "must not make mischief between man and wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "But brother, said she, do you think I'll sit at table with the creature?\n",
      "No contemptuous names, I beseech you, Lady Davers! I tell you she is\n",
      "really my wife; and I must be a villain to suffer her to be ill used.\n",
      "She has no protector but me; and, if you will permit her, she will\n",
      "always love and honour you.--Indeed, indeed I will, madam, said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot, I won't sit down at table with her, said she: Pamela, I hope\n",
      "thou dost not think I will?--Indeed, madam, said I, if your good brother\n",
      "will permit it, I will attend your chair all the time you dine, to shew\n",
      "my veneration for your ladyship, as the sister of my kind protector.\n",
      "See, said he, her condition has not altered her; but I cannot permit in\n",
      "her a conduct unworthy of my wife; and I hope my sister will not expect\n",
      "it neither.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let her leave the room, replied she, if I must stay. Indeed you are out\n",
      "of the way, aunt, said her kinsman; that is not right, as things stand.\n",
      "Said my master, No, madam, that must not be; but, if it must be so,\n",
      "we'll have two tables; you and your nephew shall sit at one, and my\n",
      "wife and I at the other: and then see what a figure your unreasonable\n",
      "punctilio will make you cut.--She seemed irresolute, and he placed her\n",
      "at the table; the first course, which was fish, being brought in. Where,\n",
      "said she to me, would'st thou presume to sit? Would'st have me give\n",
      "place to thee too, wench?--Come, come, said my master, I'll put that out\n",
      "of dispute; and so set himself down by her ladyship, at the upper end of\n",
      "the table, and placed me at his left hand. Excuse me, my dear, said he;\n",
      "this once excuse me!--Oh! your cursed complaisance, said she, to such\n",
      "a----. Hush, sister! hush! said he: I will not bear to hear her spoken\n",
      "slightly of! 'Tis enough, that, to oblige your violent and indecent\n",
      "caprice, you make me compromise with you thus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Come, sir, added he, pray take your place next your gentle aunt!--Beck,\n",
      "said she, do you sit down by Pamela there, since it must be so; we'll\n",
      "be hail fellow all! With all my heart, replied my master; I have so much\n",
      "honour for all the sex, that I would not have the meanest person of it\n",
      "stand, while I sit, had I been to have made the custom. Mrs. Worden,\n",
      "pray sit down. Sir, said she, I hope I shall know my place better.\n",
      "\n",
      "My lady sat considering; and then, lifting up her hands, said, Lord!\n",
      "what will this world come to?--To nothing but what's very good, replied\n",
      "my master, if such spirits as Lady Davers's do but take the rule of it.\n",
      "Shall I help you, sister, to some of the carp? Help your beloved! said\n",
      "she. That's kind! said he.--Now, that's my good Lady Davers! Here,\n",
      "my love, let me help you, since my sister desires it.--Mighty well,\n",
      "returned she, mighty well!--But sat on one side, turning from me, as it\n",
      "were.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear aunt, said her kinsman, let's see you buss and be friends: since\n",
      "'tis so, what signifies it? Hold thy fool's tongue! said she: Is thy\n",
      "tone so soon turned since yesterday? said my master, I hope nothing\n",
      "affronting was offered yesterday to my wife, in her own house. She hit\n",
      "him a good smart slap on the shoulder: Take that, impudent brother said\n",
      "she. I'll wife you, and in her own house! She seemed half afraid: but\n",
      "he, in very good humour, kissed her, and said, I thank you, sister, I\n",
      "thank you. But I have not had a blow from you before for some time!\n",
      "\n",
      "'Fore gad, said her kinsman, 'tis very kind of you to take it so well.\n",
      "Her ladyship is as good a woman as ever lived; but I've had many a cuff\n",
      "from her myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I won't put it up neither, said my master, except you'll assure me you\n",
      "have seen her serve her lord so.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pressed my foot to his, and said, softly, Don't, dear sir!--What! said\n",
      "she, is the creature begging me off from insult? If his manners won't\n",
      "keep him from outraging me, I won't owe his forebearance to thee, wench.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said my master, and put some fish on my lady's plate, Well does Lady\n",
      "Davers use the word insult!--But, come, let me see you eat one mouthful,\n",
      "and I'll forgive you; and he put the knife in one of her hands, and the\n",
      "fork in the other. As I hope to live, said he, I cannot bear this silly\n",
      "childishness, for nothing at all! I am quite ashamed of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She put a little bit to her mouth, but laid it down in her plate again:\n",
      "I cannot eat, said she; I cannot swallow, I'm sure. It will certainly\n",
      "choak me. He had forbid his menservants to come in, that they might not\n",
      "behold the scene he expected; and rose from table himself, and filled\n",
      "a glass of wine, her woman offering, and her kinsman rising, to do it.\n",
      "Mean-time, his seat between us being vacant, she turned to me: How now,\n",
      "confidence, said she, darest thou sit next me? Why dost thou not rise,\n",
      "and take the glass from thy property?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sit still, my dear, said he; I'll help you both. But I arose; for I was\n",
      "afraid of a good cuff; and said, Pray, sir, let me help my lady. So you\n",
      "shall, replied he, when she's in a humour to receive it as she ought.\n",
      "Sister, said he, with a glass in his hand, pray drink; you'll perhaps\n",
      "eat a little bit of something then. Is this to insult me? said she.--No,\n",
      "really, returned he: but to incite you to eat; for you'll be sick for\n",
      "want of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She took the glass, and said, God forgive you, wicked wretch, for your\n",
      "usage of me this day!--This is a little as it used to be!--I once had\n",
      "your love;--and now it is changed; and for whom? that vexes me! And wept\n",
      "so, she was forced to set down the glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "You don't do well, said he. You neither treat me like your brother nor\n",
      "a gentleman; and if you would suffer me, I would love you as well as\n",
      "ever.--But for a woman of sense and understanding, and a fine-bred\n",
      "woman, as I once thought my sister, you act quite a childish part. Come,\n",
      "added he, and held the glass to her lips, let your brother, that you\n",
      "once loved, prevail on you to drink this glass of wine.--She then drank\n",
      "it. He kissed her, and said, Oh! how passion deforms the noblest minds!\n",
      "You have lost a good deal of that loveliness that used to adorn my\n",
      "sister. And let me persuade you to compose yourself, and be my sister\n",
      "again!--For Lady Davers is, indeed, a fine woman; and has a presence as\n",
      "majestic for a lady, as her dear brother has for a gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then sat down between us again, and said, when the second course came\n",
      "in, Let Abraham come in and wait. I touched his toe again; but he minded\n",
      "it not; and I saw he was right; for her ladyship began to recollect\n",
      "herself, and did not behave half so ill before the servants, as she had\n",
      "done; and helped herself with some little freedom; but she could not\n",
      "forbear a strong sigh and a sob now and then. She called for a glass\n",
      "of the same wine she had drank before. Said he, Shall I help you again,\n",
      "Lady Davers?--and rose, at the same time, and went to the sideboard,\n",
      "and filled her a glass. Indeed, said she, I love to be soothed by my\n",
      "brother!--Your health, sir!\n",
      "\n",
      "Said my master to me, with great sweetness, My dear, now I'm up, I'll\n",
      "fill for you!--I must serve both sisters alike! She looked at the\n",
      "servant, as if he were a little check upon her, and said to my master,\n",
      "How now, sir!--Not that you know of. He whispered her, Don't shew any\n",
      "contempt before my servants to one I have so deservedly made their\n",

      "kills me.\n",

      "He gave me a glass: My good lady's health, sir, said I.--That won't do,\n",
      "said she, leaning towards me, softly: and was going to say wench, or\n",
      "creature, or some such word. And my master, seeing Abraham look towards\n",
      "her, her eyes being red and swelled, said, Indeed, sister, I would not\n",
      "vex myself about it, if I was you. About what? said she. Why, replied\n",
      "he, about your lord's not coming down, as he had promised. He sat down,\n",
      "and she tapped him on the shoulder: Ah! wicked one, said she, nor will\n",
      "that do neither!--Why, to be sure, added he, it would vex a lady of\n",
      "your sense and merit to be slighted, if it was so; but I am sure my\n",
      "lord loves you, as well as you love him; and you know not what may have\n",
      "happened.\n",
      "\n",

      "amazed you should be so caught!--Who, my lord caught! said he: No, no!\n",
      "he'll have more wit than so! But I never heard you were jealous before.\n",
      "Nor, said he, have you any reason to think so now!--Honest friend, you\n",
      "need not wait, said she; my woman will help us to what we want. Yes, let\n",
      "him, replied he. Abraham, fill me a glass. Come, said my master,\n",
      "Lord Davers to you, madam: I hope he'll take care he is not found\n",
      "out!--You're very provoking, brother, said she. I wish you were as good\n",
      "as Lord Davers.--But don't carry your jest too far. Well, said he, 'tis\n",
      "a tender point, I own. I've done.\n",
      "\n",
      "By these kind managements the dinner passed over better than I expected.\n",
      "And when the servants were withdrawn, my master said, still keeping his\n",
      "place between us, I have a question to ask you, Lady Davers, and that\n",
      "is, If you'll bear me company to Bedfordshire? I was intending to set\n",
      "out thither to-morrow, but I'll tarry your pleasure, if you'll go with\n",
      "me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is thy wife, as thou callest her, to go along with thee, friend? said\n",
      "she. Yes, to be sure, answered he, my dear Quaker sister; and took\n",
      "her hand, and smiled. And would'st have me parade it with her on the\n",
      "road?--Hey?--And make one to grace her retinue?--Hey? Tell me how\n",
      "thoud'st chalk it out, if I would do as thou would'st have me, honest\n",
      "friend?\n",
      "\n",
      "He clasped his arms about her, and kissed her: You are a dear saucy\n",
      "sister, said he; but I must love you!--Why, I'll tell you how I'd have\n",
      "it. Here shall you, and my Pamela--Leave out my, I desire you, if you'd\n",
      "have me sit patiently. No, replied he, I can't do that. Here shall you,\n",
      "and my Pamela, go together in your chariot, if you please; and she will\n",
      "then appear as one of your retinue; and your nephew and I will sometimes\n",
      "ride, and sometimes go into my chariot, to your woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Should'st thou like this, creature? said she to me.--If your ladyship\n",
      "think it not too great an honour for me, madam, said I. Yes, replied\n",
      "she, but my ladyship does think it would be too great an honour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I think of it, said he, this must not be neither; for, without you'd\n",
      "give her the hand in your own chariot, my wife would be thought your\n",
      "woman, and that must not be. Why, that would, may be, said she, be the\n",
      "only inducement for me to bear her near me, in my chariot.--But, how\n",
      "then?--Why then, when we came home, we'd get Lord Davers to come to us,\n",
      "and stay a month or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what if he was to come?--Why I would have you, as I know you have\n",
      "a good fancy, give Pamela your judgment on some patterns I expect from\n",
      "London, for clothes.--Provoking wretch! said she; now I wish I may keep\n",
      "my hands to myself. I don't say it to provoke you, said he, nor ought it\n",
      "to do so. But when I tell you I am married, is it not a consequence that\n",
      "we must have new clothes?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hast thou any more of these obliging things to say to me, friend? said\n",
      "she. I will make you a present, returned he, worth your acceptance,\n",
      "if you will grace us with your company at church, when we make our\n",
      "appearance.--Take that, said she, if I die for it, wretch that thou art!\n",
      "and was going to hit him a great slap; but he held her hand. Her kinsman\n",
      "said, Dear aunt, I wonder at you! Why, all these are things of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "I begged leave to withdraw; and, as I went out, my good master said,\n",

      "were you a man, you would doat on her, as I do. Yes, said the naughty\n",
      "lady, so I should, for my harlot, but not for my wife. I turned, on\n",
      "this, and said, Indeed your ladyship is cruel; and well may gentlemen\n",
      "take liberties, when ladies of honour say such things! And I wept, and\n",
      "added, Your ladyship's inference, if your good brother was not the most\n",
      "generous of men, would make me very unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "No fear, wench; no fear, said she; thou'lt hold him as long as any body\n",
      "can, I see that!--Poor Sally Godfrey never had half the interest in him,\n",
      "I'll assure you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stay, my Pamela, said he, in a passion; stay, when I bid you. You\n",
      "have now heard two vile charges upon me!--I love you with such a true\n",
      "affection, that I ought to say something before this malicious accuser,\n",
      "that you may not think your consummate virtue linked to so black a\n",
      "villain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her nephew seemed uneasy, and blamed her much; and I came back, but\n",
      "trembled as I stood; and he set me down, and said, taking my hand, I\n",
      "have been accused, my dear, as a dueller, and now as a profligate, in\n",
      "another sense; and there was a time I should not have received these\n",
      "imputations with so much concern as I now do, when I would wish, by\n",
      "degrees, by a conformity of my manners to your virtue, to shew every one\n",
      "the force your example has upon me. But this briefly is the case of the\n",
      "first.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a friend, who had been basely attempted to be assassinated by\n",
      "bravoes, hired by a man of title in Italy, who, like many other persons\n",
      "of title, had no honour; and, at Padua, I had the fortune to disarm\n",
      "one of these bravoes in my friend's defence, and made him confess his\n",
      "employer; and him, I own, I challenged. At Sienna we met, and he died\n",
      "in a month after, of a fever; but, I hope, not occasioned by the slight\n",
      "wounds he had received from me; though I was obliged to leave Italy\n",
      "upon it, sooner than I intended, because of his numerous relations, who\n",
      "looked upon me as the cause of his death; though I pacified them by a\n",
      "letter I wrote them from Inspruck, acquainting them with the baseness of\n",
      "the deceased: and they followed me not to Munich, as they intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is one of the good-natured hints that might shock your sweetness,\n",
      "on reflecting that you are yoked with a murderer. The other--Nay,\n",
      "brother, said she, say no more. 'Tis your own fault if you go further.\n",
      "She shall know it all, said he; and I defy the utmost stretch of your\n",
      "malice.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was at college, I was well received by a widow lady, who had\n",
      "several daughters, and but small fortunes to give them; and the old\n",
      "lady set one of them (a deserving good girl she was,) to draw me into\n",
      "marriage with her, for the sake of the fortune I was heir to; and\n",
      "contrived many opportunities to bring us and leave us together. I was\n",
      "not then of age; and the young lady, not half so artful as her mother,\n",
      "yielded to my addresses before the mother's plot could be ripened, and\n",
      "so utterly disappointed it. This, my Pamela, is the Sally Godfrey, this\n",
      "malicious woman, with the worst intentions, has informed you of. And\n",
      "whatever other liberties I may have taken, (for perhaps some more I\n",
      "have, which, had she known, you had heard of, as well as this,) I desire\n",
      "Heaven will only forgive me, till I revive its vengeance by the like\n",
      "offences, in injury to my Pamela.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, my dear, you may withdraw; for this worthy sister of mine has\n",
      "said all the bad she knows of me; and what, at a proper opportunity,\n",
      "when I could have convinced you, that they were not my boast, but my\n",
      "concern, I should have acquainted you with myself; for I am not fond of\n",
      "being thought better than I am: though I hope, from the hour I devoted\n",
      "myself to so much virtue, to that of my death, my conduct shall be\n",
      "irreproachable.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was greatly moved at this, and the noble manner in which the dear\n",
      "gentleman owned and repented of his faults; and gushed out into tears,\n",
      "and said, No, don't yet go, Pamela, I beseech you. My passion has\n",
      "carried me too far, a great deal; and, coming to me, she shook my hand,\n",
      "and said, You must stay to hear me beg his pardon; and so took his\n",
      "hand.--But, to my concern, (for I was grieved for her ladyship's grief,)\n",
      "he burst from her; and went out of the parlour into the garden in a\n",
      "violent rage, that made me tremble. Her ladyship sat down, and leaned\n",
      "her head against my bosom, and made my neck wet with her tears, holding\n",
      "me by the hands; and I wept for company.--Her kinsman walked up and down\n",
      "the parlour in a sad fret; and going out afterwards, he came in, and\n",
      "said, Mr. B---- has ordered his chariot to be got ready, and won't be\n",
      "spoken to by any body. Where is he? said she.--Walking in the garden\n",
      "till it is ready, replied he.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said she, I have indeed gone too far. I was bewitched! And\n",
      "now, said she, malicious as he calls me, will he not forgive me for a\n",
      "twelvemonth: for I tell you, Pamela, if ever you offend, he will not\n",
      "easily forgive. I was all delighted, though sad, to see her ladyship so\n",
      "good to me. Will you venture, said she, to accompany me to him?--Dare\n",
      "you follow a lion in his retreats?--I'll attend your ladyship, said I,\n",
      "wherever you command. Well, wench, said she; Pamela, I mean; thou art\n",
      "very good in the main!--I should have loved thee as well as my mother\n",
      "did--if--but 'tis all over now! Indeed you should not have married my\n",
      "brother! But come, I must love him! Let's find him out! And yet will\n",
      "he use me worse than a dog!--I should not, added she, have so much\n",
      "exasperated him: for, whenever I have, I have always had the worst of\n",
      "it. He knows I love him!\n",
      "\n",
      "In this manner her ladyship talked to me, leaning on my arm, and walking\n",
      "into the garden. I saw he was still in a tumult, as it were; and he\n",
      "took another walk to avoid us. She called after him, and said, Brother,\n",
      "brother, let me speak to you!--One word with you! And as we made haste\n",
      "towards him, and came near to him; I desire, said he, that you'll not\n",
      "oppress me more with your follies, and your violence. I have borne too\n",
      "much with you, and I will vow for a twelvemonth, from this day--Hush,\n",
      "said she, don't vow, I beg you for too well will you keep it, I know by\n",
      "experience, if you do. You see, said she, I stoop to ask Pamela to be my\n",
      "advocate. Sure that will pacify you!\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, said he, I desire to see neither of you, on such an occasion;\n",
      "and let me only be left to myself, for I will not be intruded upon thus;\n",
      "and was going away.--But, said she, One word first, I desire.--If you'll\n",
      "forgive me, I'll forgive you.--What, said the dear man, haughtily, will\n",
      "you forgive me?--Why, said she, for she saw him too angry to mention his\n",
      "marriage, as a subject that required her pardon--I will forgive you all\n",
      "your bad usage of me this day.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will be serious with you, sister, said he: I wish you most sincerely\n",
      "well; but let us, from this time, study so much one another's quiet,\n",
      "as never to come near one another more. Never? said she.--And can you\n",
      "desire this? barbarous brother! can you?--I can, I do, said he; and I\n",
      "have nothing to do, but to hide from you, not a brother, but a murderer,\n",
      "and a profligate, unworthy of your relation; and let me be consigned\n",
      "to penitence for my past evils: A penitence, however, that shall not be\n",
      "broken in upon by so violent an accuser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pamela, said he, and made me tremble, How dare you approach me, without\n",
      "leave, when you see me thus disturbed?--Never, for the future, come near\n",
      "me, when I am in these tumults, unless I send for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear sir! said I--Leave me, interrupted he. I will set out for\n",
      "Bedfordshire this moment! What! sir, said I, without me?--What have I\n",
      "done? You have too meanly, said he, for my wife, stooped to this furious\n",
      "sister of mine; and, till I can recollect, I am not pleased with you:\n",
      "But Colbrand shall attend you, and two other of my servants; and Mrs.\n",
      "Jewkes shall wait upon you part of the way: And I hope you'll find me in\n",
      "a better disposition to receive you there, than I am at parting with you\n",
      "here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had I not hoped, that this was partly put on to intimidate my lady, I\n",
      "believe I could not have borne it: But it was grievous to me; for I saw\n",
      "he was most sincerely in a passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was afraid, said she, he would be angry at you, as well as me; for\n",
      "well do I know his unreasonable violence, when he is moved. But one\n",
      "word, sir, said she; Pardon Pamela, if you won't me; for she has\n",
      "committed no offence, but that of good-nature to me, and at my request.\n",
      "I will be gone myself, directly as I was about to do, had you not\n",
      "prevented me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I prevented you, said he, through love; but you have strung me for\n",
      "it, through hatred. But as for my Pamela, I know, besides the present\n",
      "moment, I cannot be angry with her; and therefore I desire her never to\n",
      "see me, on such occasions, till I can see her in the temper I ought to\n",
      "be in, when so much sweetness approaches me. 'Tis therefore I say, my\n",
      "dearest, leave me now.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, sir, said I, must I leave you, and let you go to Bedfordshire\n",
      "without me? Oh, dear sir, how can I?--Said my lady, You may go\n",
      "to-morrow, both of you, as you had designed; and I will go away this\n",
      "afternoon: And, since I cannot be forgiven, will try to forget I have a\n",
      "brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "May I, sir, said I, beg all your anger on myself, and to be reconciled\n",
      "to your good sister? Presuming Pamela! replied he, and made me start;\n",
      "Art thou then so hardy, so well able to sustain a displeasure, which\n",
      "of all things, I expected from thy affection, and thy tenderness, thou\n",
      "would'st have wished to avoid?--Now, said he, and took my hand, and, as\n",
      "it were, tossed it from him, begone from my presence, and reflect upon\n",
      "what you have said to me!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so frightened, (for then I saw he took amiss what I said,) that I\n",
      "took hold of his knees, as he was turning from me; and I said, Forgive\n",
      "me, good sir! you see I am not so hardy! I cannot bear your displeasure!\n",
      "And was ready to sink.\n",
      "\n",
      "His sister said, Only forgive Pamela; 'tis all I ask--You'll break\n",
      "her spirit quite!--You'll carry your passion as much too far as I have\n",
      "done!--I need not say, said he, how well I love her; but she must not\n",
      "intrude upon me at such times as these!--I had intended, as soon as I\n",
      "could have quelled, by my reason, the tumults you had caused by your\n",
      "violence, to have come in, and taken such a leave of you both, as might\n",
      "become a husband, and a brother: But she has, unbidden, broke in upon\n",
      "me, and must take the consequence of a passion, which, when raised, is\n",
      "as uncontrollable as your own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said she, Did I not love you so well, as sister never loved a brother, I\n",
      "should not have given you all this trouble. And did I not, said he, love\n",
      "you better than you are resolved to deserve, I should be indifferent to\n",
      "all you say. But this last instance, after the duelling story (which\n",
      "you would not have mentioned, had you not known it is always matter\n",
      "of concern for me to think upon), of poor Sally Godfrey, is a piece of\n",
      "spite and meanness, that I can renounce you my blood for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said she, I am convinced it was wrong. I am ashamed of it myself.\n",
      "'Twas poor, 'twas mean, 'twas unworthy of your sister: And 'tis for this\n",
      "reason I stoop to follow you, to beg your pardon, and even to procure\n",
      "one for my advocate, who I thought had some interest in you, if I might\n",
      "have believed your own professions to her; which now I shall begin to\n",
      "think made purposely to insult me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I care not what you think!--After the meanness you have been guilty of,\n",
      "I can only look upon you with pity: For, indeed, you have fallen very\n",
      "low with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tis plain I have, said she. But I'll begone.--And so, brother, let me\n",
      "call you for this once! God bless you! And Pamela, said her ladyship,\n",
      "God bless you! and kissed me, and wept.\n",
      "\n",
      "I durst say no more: And my lady turning from him, he said, Your sex\n",
      "is the d---l! how strangely can you discompose, calm, and turn, as\n",
      "you please, us poor weathercocks of men! Your last kind blessing to my\n",
      "Pamela I cannot stand! Kiss but each other again. And then he took both\n",
      "our hands, and joined them; and my lady saluting me again, with tears on\n",
      "both sides, he put his kind arms about each of our waists, and saluted\n",
      "us with great affection, saying, Now, God bless you both, the two\n",
      "dearest creatures I have in the world!\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said she, you will quite forget my fault about Miss--He stopt her\n",
      "before she could speak the name, and said, For ever forget it!--And,\n",
      "Pamela, I'll forgive you too, if you don't again make my displeasure so\n",
      "light a thing to you, as you did just now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said my lady, She did not make your displeasure a light thing to her;\n",
      "but the heavier it was, the higher compliment she made me, that she\n",
      "would bear it all, rather than not see you and me reconciled. No matter\n",
      "for that, said he: It was either an absence of thought, or a slight\n",
      "by implication, at least, that my niceness could not bear from her\n",
      "tenderness: For looked it not presuming, that she could stand my\n",
      "displeasure, or was sure of making her terms when she pleased? Which,\n",
      "fond as I am of her, I assure her, will not be always, in wilful faults,\n",
      "in her power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nay, said my lady, I can tell you, Pamela, you have a gentleman here\n",
      "in my brother; and you may expect such treatment from him, as that\n",
      "character, and his known good sense and breeding, will always oblige him\n",
      "to shew: But if you offend, the Lord have mercy upon you!--You see how\n",
      "it is by poor me!--And yet I never knew him to forgive so soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure, said I, I will take care as much as I can; for I have been\n",
      "frightened out of my wits, and had offended, before I knew where I was.\n",
      "\n",
      "So happily did this storm blow over; and my lady was quite subdued and\n",
      "pacified.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we came out of the garden, his chariot was ready; and he said,\n",
      "Well, sister, I had most assuredly gone away towards my other house, if\n",
      "things had not taken this happy turn; and, if you please, instead of\n",
      "it, you and I will take an airing: And pray, my dear, said he to me, bid\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes order supper by eight o'clock, and we shall then join you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, added he, to her nephew, will you take your horse and escort us? I\n",
      "will, said he: and am glad, at my soul, to see you all so good friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "So my dear lord and master handed my lady into his chariot, and her\n",
      "kinsman and his servants rode after them and I went up to my closet to\n",

      "wife gives one privileges, in one's own account!--Yet, methinks, I want\n",
      "to know more about her; for, is it not strange, that I, who lived\n",
      "years in the family, should have heard nothing of this? But I was so\n",
      "constantly with my lady, that I might the less hear of it; for she, I\n",
      "dare say, never knew it, or she would have told me.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I dare not ask him about the poor lady.--Yet I wonder what became of\n",

      "About seven o'clock my master sent word, that he would have me not\n",
      "expect him to supper; for that he, and my lady his sister, and nephew,\n",
      "were prevailed upon to stay with Lady Jones; and that Lady Darnford, and\n",
      "Mr. Peters's family, had promised to meet them there. I was glad they\n",
      "did not send for me; and the rather, as I hoped those good families\n",
      "being my friends, would confirm my lady a little in my favour; and so I\n",
      "followed my writing closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "About eleven o'clock they returned. I had but just come down, having\n",

      "Mrs. Worden, whom I would, though unwillingly on their sides, make sit\n",
      "down, which they did over against me. Mrs. Worden asked my pardon, in a\n",
      "good deal of confusion, for the part she had acted against me; saying,\n",
      "That things had been very differently represented to her; and that she\n",
      "little thought I was married, and that she was behaving so rudely to the\n",
      "lady of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, I took nothing amiss; and very freely forgave her; and hoped my\n",
      "new condition would not make me forget how to behave properly to every\n",
      "one; but that I must endeavour to act not unworthy of it, for the honour\n",
      "of the gentleman who had so generously raised me to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes said, that my situation gave me great opportunities of\n",
      "shewing the excellence of my nature, that I could forgive offences\n",
      "against me so readily, as she, for her own part, must always, she said,\n",
      "acknowledge, with confusion of face.\n",
      "\n",
      "People, said I, Mrs. Jewkes, don't know how they shall act, when their\n",
      "wills are in the power of their superiors; and I always thought one\n",
      "should distinguish between acts of malice, and of implicit obedience;\n",
      "though, at the same time, a person should know how to judge between\n",
      "lawful and unlawful. And even the great, though at present angry they\n",
      "are not obeyed, will afterwards have no ill opinion of a person for\n",
      "withstanding them in their unlawful commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes seemed a little concerned at this; and I said, I spoke\n",
      "chiefly from my own experience: For that I might say, as they both knew\n",
      "my story, that I had not wanted both for menaces and temptations; and\n",
      "had I complied with the one, or been intimidated by the other, I should\n",
      "not have been what I was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, madam! replied Mrs. Jewkes, I never knew any body like you; and I\n",

      "if possible, you take less upon you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, a good reason, said I, may be assigned for that: I thought myself\n",
      "in danger: I looked upon every one as my enemy; and it was impossible\n",
      "that I should not be fretful, uneasy, jealous. But when my dearest\n",
      "friend had taken from me the ground of my uneasiness, and made me quite\n",
      "happy, I should have been very blamable, if I had not shewn a satisfied\n",
      "and easy mind, and a temper that should engage every one's respect and\n",
      "love at the same time, if possible: And so much the more, as it was\n",
      "but justifying, in some sort, the honour I had received: For the fewer\n",
      "enemies I made myself, the more I engaged every one to think, that my\n",
      "good benefactor had been less to blame in descending as he has done.\n",
      "\n",
      "This way of talking pleased them both very much; and they made me many\n",
      "compliments upon it, and wished me always to be happy, as, they said, I\n",
      "so well deserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were thus engaged, when my master, and his sister and her nephew,\n",
      "came in: and they made me quite alive, in the happy humour in which they\n",
      "all returned. The two women would have withdrawn: but my master said,\n",
      "Don't go, Mrs. Worden: Mrs. Jewkes, pray stay; I shall speak to you\n",
      "presently. So he came to me, and, saluting me, said, Well, my dear love,\n",
      "I hope I have not trespassed upon your patience, by an absence longer\n",
      "than we designed. But it has not been to your disadvantage; for though\n",
      "we had not your company, we have talked of nobody else but you.\n",
      "\n",
      "My lady came up to me, and said, Ay, child, you have been all our\n",
      "subject. I don't know how it is: but you have made two or three good\n",
      "families, in this neighbourhood, as much your admirers, as your friend\n",
      "here.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister, said he, has been hearing your praises, Pamela, from half\n",
      "a score mouths, with more pleasure than her heart will easily let her\n",
      "express.\n",
      "\n",
      "My good Lady Davers's favour, said I, and the continuance of yours,\n",
      "sir, would give me more pride than that of all the rest of the world put\n",
      "together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, child, said she, proud hearts don't come down all at once; though\n",
      "my brother, here, has this day set mine a good many pegs lower than I\n",
      "ever knew it: But I will say, I wish you joy with my brother; and so\n",
      "kissed me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear lady, said I, you for ever oblige me!--I shall now believe\n",
      "myself quite happy. This was all I wanted to make me so!--And I hope I\n",
      "shall always, through my life, shew your ladyship, that I have the most\n",
      "grateful and respectful sense of your goodness.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, child, said she, I shall not give you my company when you make your\n",
      "appearance. Let your own merit make all your Bedfordshire neighbours\n",
      "your friends, as it has done here, by your Lincolnshire ones; and you'll\n",
      "have no need of my countenance, nor any body's else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, said her nephew, 'tis my turn: I wish you joy with all my soul,\n",
      "madam; and, by what I have seen, and by what I have heard, 'fore Gad, I\n",
      "think you have met with no more than you deserve; and so all the company\n",
      "says, where we have been: And pray forgive all my nonsense to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, I shall always, I hope, respect as I ought, so near a\n",
      "relation of my good Lord and Lady Davers; and I thank you for your kind\n",
      "compliment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gad, Beck, said he, I believe you've some forgiveness too to ask; for we\n",
      "were all to blame, to make madam, here, fly the pit, as she did. Little\n",
      "did we think we made her quit her own house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thou always, said my lady, sayest too much, or too little.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Worden said, I have been treated with so much goodness and\n",
      "condescension since you went, that I have been beforehand, sir, in\n",
      "asking pardon myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "So my lady sat down with me half an hour, and told me, that her brother\n",
      "had carried her a fine airing, and had quite charmed her with his kind\n",
      "treatment of her; and had much confirmed her in the good opinion she had\n",
      "begun to entertain of my discreet and obliging behaviour: But, continued\n",
      "she, when he would make me visit, without intending to stay, my old\n",
      "neighbours, (for, said she, Lady Jones being nearest, we visited her\n",
      "first; and she scraped all the rest of the company together,) they were\n",
      "all so full of your praises, that I was quite borne down; and, truly, it\n",
      "was Saul among the prophets!\n",
      "\n",
      "You may believe how much I was delighted with this; and I spared not my\n",
      "due acknowledgments.\n",
      "\n",
      "When her ladyship took leave, to go to bed, she said, Goodnight to you,\n",
      "heartily, and to your good man. I kissed you when I came in, out of\n",
      "form; but I now kiss you out of more than form, I'll assure you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Join with me, my dear parents, in my joy for this happy turn; the\n",
      "contrary of which I so much dreaded, and was the only difficulty I had\n",
      "to labour with. This poor Miss Sally Godfrey, I wonder what's become\n",
      "of her, poor soul! I wish he would, of his own head, mention her\n",
      "again.--Not that I am very uneasy, neither.--You'll say, I must be a\n",
      "little saucy, if I was.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear master gave me an account, when we went up, of the pains he had\n",
      "taken with his beloved sister, as he himself styled her; and of all\n",
      "the kind things the good families had said in my behalf; and that he\n",
      "observed she was not so much displeased with hearing them, as she was\n",
      "at first; when she would not permit any body to speak of me as his wife:\n",
      "And that my health, as his spouse, being put; when it came to her, she\n",
      "drank it; but said, Come, brother, here's your Pamela to you: But I\n",
      "shall not know how to stand this affair, when the Countess----, and the\n",
      "young ladies, come to visit me. One of these young ladies was the person\n",
      "she was so fond of promoting a match for, with her brother.--Lady Betty,\n",
      "I know, she said, will rally me smartly upon it; and you know, brother,\n",
      "she wants neither wit nor satire. He said, I hope, Lady Betty, whenever\n",
      "she marries, will meet with a better husband than I should have\n",
      "made her; for, in my conscience, I think I should hardly have made a\n",
      "tolerable one to any but Pamela.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told me that they rallied him on the stateliness of his temper; and\n",
      "said, They saw he would make an exceeding good husband where he was;\n",
      "but it must be owing to my meekness, more than to his complaisance; for,\n",
      "said Miss Darnford, I could see well enough, when your ladyship detained\n",
      "her, though he had but hinted his desire of finding her at our house,\n",
      "he was so out of humour at her supposed noncompliance, that mine and my\n",
      "sister's pity for her was much more engaged, than our envy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ay, said my lady, he is too lordly a creature, by much; and can't bear\n",
      "disappointment, nor ever could.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said he, Well, Lady Davers, you should not, of all persons, find fault\n",
      "with me; for I bore a great deal from you, before I was at all angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, replied she: but when I had gone a little too far, as I own I did,\n",
      "you made me pay for it severely enough! You know you did, sauce-box. And\n",
      "the poor thing too, added she, that I took with me for my advocate, so\n",
      "low had he brought me! he treated her in such a manner as made my heart\n",
      "ache for her: But part was art, I know, to make me think the better of\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, sister, said he, there was very little of that; for, at that\n",
      "time, I cared not what you thought, nor had complaisance enough to have\n",
      "given a shilling for your good or bad opinion of her or me. And, I\n",
      "own, I was displeased to be broken in upon, after your provocations,\n",
      "by either of you and she must learn that lesson, never to come near me,\n",
      "when I am in those humours; which shall be as little as possible: For,\n",
      "after a while, if let alone, I always come to myself, and am sorry for\n",
      "the violence of a temper, so like my dear sister's here: And, for\n",
      "this reason think it is no matter how few witnesses I have of its\n",
      "intemperance, while it lasts; especially since every witness, whether\n",
      "they merit it or not, as you see in my Pamela's case, must be a sufferer\n",
      "by it, if, unsent for, they come in my way.\n",
      "\n",
      "He repeated the same lesson to me again, and enforced it and owned, that\n",
      "he was angry with me in earnest, just then; though more with himself,\n",
      "afterwards, for being so: But when, Pamela, said he, you wanted to\n",
      "transfer all my displeasure upon yourself, it was so much braving me\n",
      "with your merit, as if I must soon end my anger, if placed there; or\n",
      "it was making it so light to you, that I was truly displeased: for,\n",
      "continued he, I cannot bear that you should wish, on any occasion\n",
      "whatever, to have me angry with you, or not to value my displeasure as\n",
      "the heaviest misfortune that could befall you.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, sir, said I, you know, that what I did was to try to reconcile my\n",
      "lady; and, as she herself observed, it was paying her a high regard. It\n",
      "was so, replied he; but never think of making a compliment to her, or\n",
      "any body living, at my expense. Besides, she had behaved herself so\n",
      "intolerably, that I began to think you had stooped too much, and more\n",
      "than I ought to permit my wife to do; and acts of meanness are what I\n",
      "can't endure in any body, but especially where I love: and as she had\n",
      "been guilty of a very signal one, I had much rather have renounced her\n",
      "at that time, than have been reconciled to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, I hope I shall always comport myself so, as not wilfully\n",
      "to disoblige you for the future; and the rather do I hope this, as I\n",
      "am sure I shall want only to know your pleasure to obey it. But this\n",
      "instance shews me, that I may much offend, without designing it in the\n",
      "least.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Pamela, replied he, don't be too serious: I hope I shan't be a very\n",
      "tyrannical husband to you: Yet do I not pretend to be perfect, or to\n",
      "be always governed by reason in my first transports; and I expect, from\n",
      "your affection, that you will bear with me when you find me wrong. I\n",
      "have no ungrateful spirit, and can, when cool, enter as impartially\n",
      "into myself as most men; and then I am always kind and acknowledging, in\n",
      "proportion as I have been out of the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to convince you, my dear, continued he, of your fault, (I mean, with\n",
      "regard to the impetuosity of my temper; for there was no fault in your\n",
      "intention, that I acknowledge,) I'll observe only, that you met, when\n",
      "you came to me, while I was so out of humour, a reception you did not\n",
      "expect, and a harsh word or two that you did not deserve. Now, had you\n",
      "not broken in upon me while my anger lasted, but staid till I had come\n",
      "to you, or sent to desire your company, you'd have seen none of this;\n",
      "but that affectionate behaviour, which I doubt not you'll always merit,\n",
      "and I shall always take pleasure in expressing: and in this temper shall\n",
      "you always find a proper influence over me: But you must not suppose,\n",
      "whenever I am out of humour, that, in opposing yourself to my passion,\n",
      "you oppose a proper butt to it; but when you are so good, like the\n",
      "slender reed, to bend to the hurricane, rather than, like the sturdy\n",
      "oak, to resist it, you will always stand firm in my kind opinion, while\n",
      "a contrary conduct would uproot you, with all your excellencies, from my\n",
      "soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, I will endeavour to conform myself, in all things, to your\n",
      "will. I make no doubt but you will: and I'll endeavour to make my will\n",
      "as conformable to reason as I can. And let me tell you, that this belief\n",
      "of you is one of the inducements I have had to marry at all: for nobody\n",
      "was more averse to this state than myself; and, now we are upon this\n",
      "subject, I'll tell you why I was so averse.\n",
      "\n",
      "We people of fortune, or such as are born to large expectations, of both\n",
      "sexes, are generally educated wrong. You have occasionally touched upon\n",
      "this, Pamela, several times in your journal, so justly, that I need say\n",
      "the less to you. We are usually so headstrong, so violent in our wills,\n",
      "that we very little bear control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Humoured by our nurses, through the faults of our parents, we practise\n",
      "first upon them; and shew the gratitude of our dispositions, in\n",
      "an insolence that ought rather to be checked and restrained, than\n",
      "encouraged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we are to be indulged in every thing at school; and our masters\n",
      "and mistresses are rewarded with further grateful instances of our\n",
      "boisterous behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, in our wise parents' eyes, all looks well, all is forgiven and\n",
      "excused; and for no other reason, but because we are theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our next progression is, we exercise our spirits, when brought home,\n",
      "to the torment and regret of our parents themselves, and torture their\n",
      "hearts by our undutiful and perverse behaviour to them, which, however\n",
      "ungrateful in us, is but the natural consequence of their culpable\n",
      "indulgence to us, from infancy upwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, next, after we have, perhaps, half broken their hearts, a\n",
      "wife is looked out for: convenience, or birth, or fortune, are the first\n",
      "motives, affection the last (if it is at all consulted): and two people\n",
      "thus educated, thus trained up, in a course of unnatural ingratitude,\n",
      "and who have been headstrong torments to every one who has had a share\n",
      "in their education, as well as to those to whom they owe their being,\n",
      "are brought together; and what can be expected, but that they should\n",
      "pursue, and carry on, the same comfortable conduct in matrimony, and\n",
      "join most heartily to plague one another? And, in some measure, indeed,\n",
      "this is right; because hereby they revenge the cause of all those who\n",
      "have been aggrieved and insulted by them, upon one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gentleman has never been controlled: the lady has never been\n",

      "tenderness.\n",
      "\n",
      "So great is the difference between what they both expect from one\n",
      "another, and what they both find in each other, that no wonder\n",
      "misunderstandings happen; that these ripen to quarrels; that acts of\n",
      "unkindness pass, which, even had the first motive to their union been\n",

      "\n",
      "Appeals to parents or guardians often ensue. If, by mediation of\n",
      "friends, a reconciliation takes place, it hardly ever holds: for why?\n",
      "The fault is in the minds of both, and neither of them will think so;\n",
      "so that the wound (not permitted to be probed) is but skinned over, and\n",
      "rankles still at the bottom, and at last breaks out with more pain and\n",
      "anguish than before. Separate beds are often the consequence; perhaps\n",
      "elopements: if not, an unconquerable indifference, possibly aversion.\n",
      "And whenever, for appearance-sake, they are obliged to be together,\n",
      "every one sees, that the yawning husband, and the vapourish wife, are\n",

      "not have done so. I must have loved her exceedingly well, before I had\n",
      "consented to knit the knot with her, and preferred her to all her sex;\n",
      "for without this, Pamela, indifferences, if not disgusts, will arise in\n",
      "every wedded life, that could not have made me happy at home; and there\n",

      "expostulations, after her compliance had passed, than to rectify my\n",
      "motions for the future; and it would have been impossible then, but I\n",

      "\n",
      "Let me see: What are the rules I am to observe from this awful lecture?\n",
      "Why these:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. That I must not, when he is in great wrath with any body, break in\n",
      "upon him without his leave. Well, I'll remember it, I warrant. But yet I\n",
      "think this rule is almost peculiar to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. That I must think his displeasure the heaviest thing that can befall\n",
      "me. To be sure I shall.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. And so that I must not wish to incur it, to save any body else. I'll\n",
      "be further if I do.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. That I must never make a compliment to any body at his expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. That I must not be guilty of any acts of wilful meanness. There is\n",
      "a great deal meant in this; and I'll endeavour to observe it all. To be\n",
      "sure, the occasion on which he mentions this, explains it; that I must\n",
      "say nothing, though in anger, that is spiteful or malicious; that is\n",
      "disrespectful or undutiful, and such-like.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. That I must bear with him, even when I find him in the wrong. This is\n",
      "a little hard, as the case may be!\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder whether poor Miss Sally Godfrey be living or dead!\n",
      "\n",
      "7. That I must be as flexible as the reed in the fable, lest, by\n",
      "resisting the tempest, like the oak, I be torn up by the roots. Well,\n",
      "I'll do the best I can!--There is no great likelihood, I hope, that\n",
      "I should be too perverse; yet sure, the tempest will not lay me quite\n",
      "level with the ground, neither.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. That the education of young people of condition is generally wrong.\n",
      "Memorandum; That if any part of children's education fall to my lot, I\n",
      "never indulge and humour them in things that they ought to be restrained\n",
      "in.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. That I accustom them to bear disappointments and control.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. That I suffer them not to be too much indulged in their infancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Nor at school.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Nor spoil them when they come home.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. For that children generally extend their perverseness from the nurse\n",
      "to the schoolmaster: from the schoolmaster to the parents:\n",
      "\n",
      "14. And, in their next step, as a proper punishment for all, make their\n",
      "ownselves unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. That undutiful and perverse children make bad husbands and wives:\n",
      "And, collaterally, bad masters and mistresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. That, not being subject to be controlled early, they cannot, when\n",
      "married, bear one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "17. That the fault lying deep, and in the minds of each other, neither\n",
      "will mend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "18. Whence follow misunderstandings, quarrels, appeals, ineffectual\n",
      "reconciliations, separations, elopements; or, at best, indifference;\n",
      "perhaps, aversion.--Memorandum; A good image of unhappy wedlock, in the\n",
      "words YAWNING HUSBAND, and VAPOURISH WIFE, when together: But separate,\n",
      "both quite alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "19. Few married persons behave as he likes. Let me ponder this with awe\n",
      "and improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "20. Some gentlemen can compromise with their wives, for quietness sake;\n",
      "but he can't. Indeed I believe that's true; I don't desire he should.\n",
      "\n",
      "21. That love before marriage is absolutely necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "22. That there are fewer instances of men's than women's loving better\n",
      "after marriage. But why so? I wish he had given his reasons for this! I\n",
      "fancy they would not have been to the advantage of his own sex.\n",
      "\n",
      "23. That a woman give her husband reason to think she prefers him before\n",
      "all men. Well, to be sure this should be so.\n",
      "\n",
      "24. That if she would overcome, it must be by sweetness and\n",
      "complaisance; that is, by yielding, he means, no doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "25. Yet not such a slavish one neither, as should rather seem the effect\n",
      "of her insensibility, than judgment or affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "26. That the words COMMAND and OBEY shall be blotted out of the\n",
      "Vocabulary. Very good!\n",
      "\n",
      "27. That a man should desire nothing of his wife, but what is\n",
      "significant, reasonable, just. To be sure, that is right.\n",
      "\n",
      "28. But then, that she must not shew reluctance, uneasiness, or doubt,\n",
      "to oblige him; and that too at half a word; and must not be bid twice to\n",
      "do one thing. But may not there be some occasions, where this may be a\n",
      "little dispensed with? But he says afterwards, indeed,\n",
      "\n",
      "29. That this must be only while he took care to make her compliance\n",
      "reasonable, and consistent with her free agency, in points that ought to\n",
      "be allowed her. Come, this is pretty well, considering.\n",
      "\n",
      "30. That if the husband be set upon a wrong thing, she must not dispute\n",
      "with him, but do it and, expostulate afterwards. Good sirs! I don't know\n",
      "what to say to this! It looks a little hard, methinks! This would bear a\n",
      "smart debate, I fancy, in a parliament of women. But then he says,\n",
      "\n",
      "31. Supposing they are only small points that are in dispute. Well, this\n",
      "mends it a little. For small points, I think, should not be stood upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "32. That the greatest quarrels among friends (and wives and husbands\n",
      "are, or should be, friends) arise from small matters. I believe this is\n",
      "very true; for I had like to have had anger here, when I intended very\n",
      "well.\n",
      "\n",
      "33. That a wife should not desire to convince her husband for\n",
      "CONTRADICTION sake, but for HIS OWN. As both will find their account in\n",
      "this, if one does, I believe 'tis very just.\n",
      "\n",
      "34. That in all companies a wife must shew respect and love to her\n",
      "husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "35. And this for the sake of her own reputation and security; for,\n",
      "\n",
      "36. That rakes cannot have a greater encouragement to attempt a married\n",
      "lady's virtue, than her slight opinion of her husband. To be sure this\n",
      "stands to reason, and is a fine lesson.\n",
      "\n",
      "37. That a wife should therefore draw a kind veil over her husband's\n",
      "faults.\n",
      "\n",
      "38. That such as she could not conceal, she should extenuate.\n",
      "\n",
      "39. That his virtues she should place in an advantageous light\n",
      "\n",
      "40. And shew the world, that he had HER good opinion at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "41. That she must value his friends for his sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "42. That she must be cheerful and easy in her behaviour, to whomsoever\n",
      "he brings home with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "43. That whatever faults she sees in him, she never blame him before\n",
      "company.\n",
      "\n",
      "44. At least, with such an air of superiority, as if she had a less\n",
      "opinion of his judgment than her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "45. That a man of nice observation cannot be contented to be only\n",
      "moderately happy in a wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "46. That a wife take care how she ascribe supererogatory merit to\n",
      "herself; so as to take the faults of others upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, I think it is well if we can bear our own! This is of the same\n",
      "nature with the third; and touches upon me, on the present occasion, for\n",
      "this wholesome lecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "47. That his imperfections must not be a plea for hers. To be sure, 'tis\n",
      "no matter how good the women are; but 'tis to be hoped men will allow a\n",
      "little. But, indeed, he says,\n",
      "\n",
      "48. That a husband, who expects all this, is to be incapable of\n",
      "returning insult for obligation, or evil for good; and ought not to\n",
      "abridge her of any privilege of her sex.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, my dear parents, I think this last rule crowns the rest, and makes\n",
      "them all very tolerable; and a generous man, and a man of sense, cannot\n",
      "be too much obliged. And, as I have this happiness, I shall be very\n",
      "unworthy, if I do not always so think, and so act.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, after all, you'll see I have not the easiest task in the world. But\n",
      "I know my own intentions, that I shall not wilfully err; and so fear the\n",
      "less.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not one hint did he give, that I durst lay hold of, about poor Miss\n",
      "Sally Godfrey. I wish my lady had not spoken of it: for it has given me\n",
      "a curiosity that is not quite so pretty in me; especially so early in my\n",
      "nuptials, and in a case so long ago past. Yet he intimated too, to his\n",
      "sister, that he had had other faults, (of this sort, I suppose,) that\n",
      "had not come to her knowledge!--But I make no doubt he has seen his\n",
      "error, and will be very good for the future. I wish it, and pray it may\n",
      "be so, for his own dear sake!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Wednesday, the seventh.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I arose in the morning, I went to wait on Lady Davers, seeing her\n",
      "door open; and she was in bed, but awake, and talking to her woman. I\n",
      "said, I hope I don't disturb your ladyship. Not at all, said she; I am\n",
      "glad to see you. How do you do? Well, added she, when do you set out for\n",
      "Bedfordshire?--I said, I can't tell, madam; it was designed as to-day,\n",
      "but I have heard no more of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sit down, said she, on the bed-side.--I find, by the talk we had\n",
      "yesterday and last night, you have had but a poor time of it, Pamela, (I\n",
      "must call you so yet, said she,) since you were brought to this house,\n",
      "till within these few days. And Mrs. Jewkes too has given Beck such an\n",
      "account, as makes me pity you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, madam, said I, if your ladyship knew all, you would pity me; for\n",
      "never poor creature was so hard put to it. But I ought to forget it all\n",
      "now, and be thankful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, said she, as far as I can find, 'tis a mercy you are here now. I\n",
      "was sadly moved with some part of your story and you have really made a\n",
      "noble defence, and deserve the praises of all our sex.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was God enabled me, madam, replied I. Why, said she, 'tis the more\n",
      "extraordinary, because I believe, if the truth was known, you loved the\n",
      "wretch not a little. While my trials lasted, madam, said I, I had not a\n",
      "thought of any thing, but to preserve my innocence, much less of love.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, tell me truly, said she, did you not love him all the time? I had\n",
      "always, madam, answered I, a great reverence for my master, and thought\n",
      "all his good actions doubly good and for his naughty ones, though I\n",
      "abhorred his attempts upon me, yet I could not hate him; and always\n",
      "wished him well; but I did not know that it was love. Indeed I had not\n",
      "the presumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sweet girl! said she; that's prettily said: But when he found he could\n",
      "not gain his ends, and began to be sorry for your sufferings, and to\n",
      "admire your virtue, and to profess honourable love to you, what did you\n",
      "think?\n",
      "\n",
      "Think! Indeed, madam, I did not know what to think! could neither hope\n",
      "nor believe so great an honour would fall to my lot, and feared more\n",
      "from his kindness, for some time, than I had done from his unkindness:\n",
      "And, having had a private intimation, from a kind friend, of a sham\n",
      "marriage, intended by means of a man who was to personate a minister, it\n",
      "kept my mind in too much suspense, to be greatly overjoyed at his kind\n",
      "declaration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said she, I think he did make two or three attempts upon you in\n",
      "Bedfordshire? Yes, madam, said I; he was very naughty, to be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "And here he proposed articles to you, I understand? Yes, madam, replied\n",
      "I; but I abhorred so much the thoughts of being a kept creature, that\n",
      "I rejected them with great boldness; and was resolved to die before I\n",
      "would consent to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He afterwards attempted you, I think: Did he not? O yes, madam, said I,\n",
      "a most sad attempt he made! and I had like to have been lost; for\n",
      "Mrs. Jewkes was not so good as she should have been. And so I told\n",
      "her ladyship that sad affair, and how I fell into fits; and that they\n",
      "believing me dying, forbore.--Any attempts after this base one? she\n",
      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not so good as he should have been, returned I, once in the\n",
      "garden, afterwards; but I was so watchful, and so ready to take the\n",

      "\n",
      "But, said she, did he not threaten you, at times, and put on his stern\n",
      "airs, every now and then?--Threaten, madam, replied I; yes, I had enough\n",
      "of that! I thought I should have died for fear several times.--How could\n",
      "you bear that? said she: for he is a most daring and majestic mortal! He\n",
      "has none of your puny hearts, but is as courageous as a lion; and, boy\n",
      "and man, never feared any thing. I myself, said she, have a pretty good\n",
      "spirit; but, when I have made him truly angry, I have always been forced\n",
      "to make it up with him, as well as I could: for, child, he is not one\n",
      "that is easily reconciled, I assure you.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, after he had professed honourable love to you, did he never attempt\n",
      "you again?--No, indeed, madam, he did not. But he was a good while\n",
      "struggling with himself, and with his pride, as he was pleased to call\n",
      "it, before he could stoop so low; and considered, and considered again:\n",
      "and once, upon my saying but two or three words, that displeased him,\n",
      "when he was very kind to me, he turned me out of doors, in a manner,\n",
      "at an hour's warning; for he sent me above a day's journey towards my\n",
      "father's; and then sent a man and horse, post-haste, to fetch me back\n",
      "again; and has been exceedingly kind and gracious to me ever since, and\n",
      "made me happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "That sending you away, said she, one hour, and sending after you the\n",
      "next, is exactly like my brother; and 'tis well if he don't turn you off\n",
      "twice or thrice before a year comes about, if you vex him: and he would\n",
      "have done the same by the first lady in the land, if he had been\n",
      "married to her. Yet has he his virtues, as well as his faults; for he is\n",
      "generous; nay, he is noble in his spirit; hates little dirty actions: he\n",
      "delights in doing good; but does not pass over a wilful fault easily. He\n",
      "is wise, prudent, sober, and magnanimous, and will not tell a lie,\n",
      "nor disguise his faults; but you must not expect to have him all to\n",
      "yourself, I doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'll no more harp upon this string: You see how he was exasperated\n",
      "at me; and he seemed to be angry at you too; though something of it was\n",
      "art, I believe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, madam, said I, he has been pleased to give me a most noble\n",
      "lecture; and I find he was angry with me in earnest, and that it will\n",
      "not be an easy task to behave unexceptionably to him: for he is very\n",
      "nice and delicate in his notions, I perceive; but yet, as your ladyship\n",
      "says, exceeding generous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said she, I'm glad thou hadst a little bit of his anger; else I\n",
      "should have thought it art; and I don't love to be treated with low art,\n",
      "any more than he; and I should have been vexed if he had done it by me.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I understand, child, said she, that you keep a journal of all\n",
      "matters that pass, and he has several times found means to get at it:\n",
      "Should you care I should see it? It could not be to your disadvantage;\n",
      "for I find it had no small weight with him in your favour; and I should\n",
      "take great pleasure to read all his stratagems, attempts, contrivances,\n",
      "menaces, and offers to you, on one hand, and all your pretty\n",
      "counter-plottings, which he much praises; your resolute resistance, and\n",
      "the noble stand you have made to preserve your virtue; and the steps by\n",
      "which his pride was subdued, and his mind induced to honourable love,\n",
      "till you were made what you now are: for it must be a rare and uncommon\n",
      "story; and will not only give me great pleasure in reading, but will\n",
      "entirely reconcile me to the step he has taken: and that, let me tell\n",
      "you, is what I never thought to be; for I had gone a great way in\n",
      "bringing about a match with him and Lady Betty--; and had said so much\n",
      "of it, that the earl, her father, approved of it: and so did the Duke of\n",
      "----, her uncle; and Lady Betty herself was not averse: and now I shall\n",
      "be hunted to death about it; and this has made me so outrageous as you\n",
      "have seen me upon the matter. But when I can find, by your writings,\n",
      "that your virtue is but suitably rewarded, it will be not only a good\n",
      "excuse for me, but for him, and make me love you. There is nothing that\n",
      "I would not do, said I, to oblige your ladyship; but my poor father and\n",
      "mother (who would rather have seen me buried quick in the earth, than\n",
      "to be seduced by the greatest of princes) have them in their hands at\n",
      "present; and your dear brother has bespoken them, when they have done\n",
      "reading them: but, if he gives me leave, I will shew them to your\n",
      "ladyship, with all my heart; not doubting your generous allowances, as\n",
      "I have had his; though I have treated him very freely all the way, while\n",
      "he had naughty views; and that your ladyship would consider them as\n",
      "the naked sentiments of my heart, from time to time delivered to those,\n",
      "whose indulgence I was sure of; and for whose sight only they were\n",
      "written.\n",
      "\n",
      "Give me a kiss now, said her ladyship, for your cheerful compliance: for\n",
      "I make no doubt my brother will consent I shall see them, because they\n",
      "must needs make for your honour; and I see he loves you better than any\n",
      "one in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard, continued her ladyship, a mighty good character of your\n",
      "parents, as industrious, honest, sensible, good folks, who know the\n",
      "world; and, as I doubt not my brother's generosity, I am glad they will\n",
      "make no ill figure in the world's eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madam, said I, they are the honestest, the lovingest, and the most\n",
      "conscientious couple breathing. They once lived creditably; and brought\n",
      "up a great family, of which I am the youngest; but had misfortunes,\n",
      "through their doing beyond their power for two unhappy brothers, who are\n",
      "both dead, and whose debts they stood bound for; and so became reduced,\n",
      "and, by harsh creditors, (where most of the debts were, not of their own\n",
      "contracting,) turned out of all; and having, without success, tried to\n",
      "set up a little country-school; (for my father understood a little of\n",
      "accounts, and wrote a pretty good hand;) forced to take to hard labour;\n",
      "but honest all the time; contented; never repining; and loving to one\n",
      "another; and, in the midst of their poverty and disappointments, above\n",
      "all temptation; and all their fear was, that I should be wicked, and\n",
      "yield to temptation for the sake of worldly riches and to God's grace,\n",
      "and their good lessons, and those I imbibed from my dear good lady,\n",
      "your ladyship's mother, it is that I owe the preservation of my\n",
      "innocence,--and the happy station I am exalted to.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was pleased to kiss me again, and said, There is such a noble\n",
      "simplicity in thy story, such an honest artlessness in thy mind, and\n",
      "such a sweet humility in thy deportment, notwithstanding thy present\n",
      "station, that I believe I shall be forced to love thee, whether I will\n",
      "or not: and the sight of your papers, I dare say, will crown the work;\n",
      "will disarm my pride, banish my resentment on Lady Betty's account, and\n",
      "justify my brother's conduct; and, at the same time, redound to your own\n",
      "everlasting honour, as well as to the credit of our sex: and so I make\n",
      "no doubt but my brother will let me see them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worden, said my lady, I can say any thing before you; and you will take\n",
      "no notice of our conversation; but I see you are much touched with it:\n",
      "Did you ever hear any thing prettier, more unaffected, sincere, free,\n",
      "easy?--No, never, madam, answered she, in my life; and it is a great\n",
      "pleasure to see so happy a reconciliation taking place, where there is\n",
      "so much merit.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, I have discovered so much prudence in Mrs. Worden, that, as well\n",
      "for that, as for the confidence your ladyship places in her, I have made\n",
      "no scruple of speaking my mind freely before her; and of blaming my\n",
      "dear master while he was blameworthy, as well as acknowledging his\n",
      "transcendent goodness to me since; which, I am sure, exceeds all I can\n",
      "ever deserve. May be not, said my lady; I hope you'll be very happy in\n",
      "one another; and I'll now rise, and tell him my thoughts, and ask him\n",
      "to let me have the reading of your papers; for I promise myself much\n",
      "pleasure in them; and shall not grudge a journey and a visit to you, to\n",
      "the other house, to fetch them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your ladyship's favour, said I, was all I had to wish for; and if I have\n",
      "that, and the continuance of your dear brother's goodness to me, I shall\n",
      "be easy under whatever else may happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so I took my leave, and withdrew; and she let me hear her say to\n",
      "Mrs. Worden, 'Tis a charming creature, Worden!--I know not which excels;\n",
      "her person, or her mind!--And so young a creature too!--Well may my\n",
      "brother love her!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am afraid, my dear father and mother, I shall now be too proud indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had once a good mind to have asked her ladyship about Miss Sally\n",
      "Godfrey; but I thought it was better let alone, since she did not\n",
      "mention It herself. May be I shall hear it too soon. But I hope not. I\n",
      "wonder, though, whether she be living or dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "We breakfasted together with great good temper; and my lady was very\n",
      "kind, and, asking my good master, he gave leave very readily, she should\n",
      "see all my papers, when you returned them to me; and he said, He\n",
      "was sure, when she came to read them, she would say, that I had well\n",
      "deserved the fortune I had met with: and would be of opinion, that all\n",
      "the kindness of his future life would hardly be a sufficient reward for\n",
      "my virtue, and make me amends for my sufferings.\n",
      "\n",
      "My lady resolving to set out the next morning to return to her lord, my\n",

      "family, etc. and reciprocal good wishes all around; and a promise\n",
      "obtained from my benefactor, that he would endeavour to pass a fortnight\n",
      "or three weeks in these parts, before the winter set in; I shall\n",
      "conclude this day with observing, that I disposed of the money my\n",
      "master was so good to put into my hands, in the manner he was pleased to\n",
      "direct; and I gave Mrs. Jewkes hers in such a manner as highly pleased\n",
      "her; and she wished me, with tears, all kinds of happiness; and prayed\n",
      "me to forgive her all her wickedness to me, as she herself called it. I\n",
      "begged leave of my master to present Mrs. Worden with five guineas for a\n",
      "pair of gloves; which he said was well thought of.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should have mentioned, that Miss Darnford and I agreed upon a\n",
      "correspondence, which will be no small pleasure to me; for she is an\n",
      "admirable young lady, whom I prefer to every one I have seen; and I\n",

      "On Thursday morning my lady set out for her own seat; and my best friend\n",

      "dear house. Her ladyship parted with her brother and me with great\n",
      "tenderness, and made me promise to send her my papers; which I find\n",
      "she intends to entertain Lady Betty with, and another lady or two, her\n",

      "\n",
      "My dearest master has been all love and tenderness on the road, as he is\n",
      "in every place, and on every occasion. And oh, what a delightful change\n",
      "was this journey, to that which, so contrary to all my wishes, and so\n",
      "much to my apprehensions, carried me hence to the Lincolnshire house!\n",
      "And how did I bless God at every turn, and at every stage!\n",
      "\n",
      "We did not arrive here till yesterday noon. Abraham rode before, to let\n",

      "I had encountered; a poor cast-off servant girl; and now returning a\n",
      "joyful wife, and the mistress, through his favour, of the noble house I\n",
      "was turned out of; that I was hardly able to support the joy I felt in\n",
      "my mind on the occasion. He saw how much I was moved, and tenderly asked\n",
      "me, Why I seemed so affected? I told him, and lifted his dear hand to\n",
      "my lips, and said, O sir! God's mercies, and your goodness to me on\n",
      "entering this dear, dear place, are above my expression; I can hardly\n",
      "bear the thoughts of them!--He said, Welcome, thrice welcome, joy of my\n",
      "life! to your own house; and kissed my hand in return. All the common\n",
      "servants stood at the windows, as unseen as they could, to observe us.\n",
      "He took my hand, with the most condescending goodness in the world; and,\n",
      "with great complaisance, led me into the parlour, and kissed me with\n",
      "the greatest ardour. Welcome again, my dearest life! said he, a thousand\n",

      "not to be utterly unworthy; and then how happy shall I be! God give me,\n",
      "my dearest, said he, life and health to reward all your sweetness! and\n",
      "no man can be so blest as I.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where (said he to Abraham, who passed by the door), where is Mrs.\n",

      "I, waiting impatiently, till called for, to congratulate you both.--I\n",
      "ran to her, and clasped my arms about her neck, and kissed her; O my\n",
      "dear Mrs. Jervis! said I, my other dear mother! receive your happy,\n",
      "happy Pamela; and join with me to bless God, and bless our master, for\n",
      "all these great things!--I was ready to sink in her arms through excess\n",
      "of joy, to see the dear good woman, who had been so often a mournful\n",
      "witness of my distress, as now of my triumph.--Dearest madam, said she,\n",
      "you do me too much honour. Let my whole life shew the joy I take in your\n",
      "deserved good fortune, and in my duty to you, for the early instance I\n",
      "received of your goodness in your kind letter. O Mrs. Jervis! replied\n",
      "I, there all thanks are due, both from you and me: for our dear master\n",
      "granted me this blessing, as I may justly call it, the very first\n",
      "moment I begged it of him. Your goodness, sir, said she, I will for ever\n",
      "acknowledge; and I beg pardon for the wrong step I made in applying to\n",
      "my Lady Davers.--He was so good as to salute her, and said, All is over\n",
      "now, Mrs. Jervis; and I shall not remember you ever disobliged me. I\n",
      "always respected you, and shall now more and more value you, for the\n",

      "the good folks, presently; and let me go up with you to behold the dear\n",
      "apartments, which I have seen before with such different emotions to\n",
      "what I shall now do.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went up; and in every room, the chamber I took refuge in, when my\n",

      "room, not forgetting her closet, my own little bed-chamber, the\n",
      "green-room, and in each of the others, I blessed God for my past\n",
      "escapes, and present happiness; and the good woman was quite affected\n",
      "with the zeal and pleasure with which I made my thankful acknowledgments\n",
      "to the divine goodness. O my excellent lady! said she, you are still the\n",
      "same good, pious, humble soul I knew you; and your marriage has added to\n",
      "your graces, as I hope it will to your blessings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear Mrs. Jervis, said I, you know not what I have gone through! You\n",
      "know not what God has done for me! You know not what a happy creature I\n",
      "am now! I have a thousand thousand things to tell you; and a whole week\n",
      "will be too little, every moment of it spent in relating to you what\n",
      "has befallen me, to make you acquainted with it all. We shall be sweetly\n",
      "happy together, I make no doubt. But I charge you, my dear Mrs. Jervis,\n",
      "whatever you call me before strangers, that when we are by ourselves you\n",
      "call me nothing but your Pamela. For what an ungrateful creature should\n",
      "I be, who have received so many mercies, if I attributed them not to the\n",
      "divine goodness, but assumed to myself insolent airs upon them! No, I\n",
      "hope I shall be, more and more thankful, as I am more and more blest!\n",
      "and more humble, as God, the author of all my happiness, shall more\n",
      "distinguish me.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went down again to the parlour, to my dear master. Said he, Call\n",
      "Longman in again; he longs to see you, my dear. He came in: God bless\n",
      "you, my sweet lady, said he; as now, Heaven be praised, I may call you!\n",
      "Did I not tell you, madam, that Providence would find you out? O, Mr.\n",
      "Longman, said I, God be praised for all his mercies! I am rejoiced to\n",
      "see you; and I laid my hand on his, and said, Good Mr. Longman, how\n",
      "do you do?--I must always value you; and you don't know how much of my\n",
      "present happiness I owe to the sheets of paper, and pens and ink, you\n",
      "furnished me with. I hope my dear sir and you are quite reconciled.--O,\n",
      "madam, said he, how good you are! Why, I cannot contain myself for joy!\n",
      "and then he wiped his eyes; good man!\n",
      "\n",
      "Said my master, Yes, I have been telling Longman that I am obliged to\n",
      "him for his ready return to me; and that I will entirely forget his\n",
      "appeal to Lady Davers; and I hope he'll find himself quite as easy and\n",
      "happy as he wishes. My dear partner here, Mr. Longman, I dare promise\n",
      "you, will do all she can to make you so.--Heaven bless you both\n",
      "together! said he. 'Tis the pride of my heart to see this! I returned\n",
      "with double delight, when I heard the blessed news; and I am sure, sir,\n",
      "said he, (mark old Longman's words,) God will bless you for this every\n",
      "year more and more! You don't know how many hearts you have made happy\n",
      "by this generous deed!--I am glad of it, said my dear master; I am\n",
      "sure I have made my own happy: and, Longman, though I must think you\n",
      "SOMEBODY, yet, as you are not a young man, and so won't make me jealous,\n",
      "I can allow you to wish my dear wife joy in the tenderest manner. Adad!\n",
      "sir, said he, I am sure you rejoice me with your favour: 'Tis what I\n",
      "longed for, but durst not presume. My dear, said my master, receive\n",
      "the compliment of one of the honestest hearts in England, that always\n",
      "revered your virtues!--and the good man saluted me with great respect,\n",
      "and said, God in Heaven bless you both! and kneeled on one knee. I must\n",
      "quit your presence! Indeed I must!--And away he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your goodness, sir, said I, knows no bounds: O may my gratitude never\n",
      "find any!--I saw, said my master, when the good man approached you, that\n",
      "he did it with so much awe and love mingled together, that I fancied he\n",
      "longed to salute my angel; and I could not but indulge his honest\n",
      "heart. How blessed am I! said I, and kissed his hand.--And indeed I make\n",
      "nothing now of kissing his dear hand, as if it was my own!\n",
      "\n",
      "When honest old Mr. Jonathan come in to attend at dinner, so clean, so\n",

      "Mr. Jonathan, how do you do? I am glad to see you.--You look as well as\n",
      "ever, thank God! O, dear madam! said he, better than ever, to have such\n",
      "a blessed sight! God bless you and my good master!--and I hope, sir,\n",
      "said he, you'll excuse all my past failings. Ay, that I will, Jonathan,\n",
      "said he; because you never had any, but what your regard for my dear\n",
      "wife here was the occasion of. And now I can tell you, you can never\n",
      "err, because you cannot respect her too much. O sir, said he, your\n",
      "honour is exceeding good! I'm sure I shall always pray for you both.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner, Mr. Longman coming in, and talking of some affairs under\n",
      "his care, he said afterwards, All your honour's servants are now happy;\n",
      "for Robert, who left you, had a pretty little fortune fallen to him, or\n",
      "he never would have quitted your service. He was here but yesterday, to\n",
      "inquire when you and my lady returned hither; and hoped he might have\n",
      "leave to pay his duty to you both. Ay, said my master, I shall be glad\n",
      "to see honest Robert; for that's another of your favourites, Pamela. It\n",
      "was high time, I think, I should marry you, were it but to engage\n",
      "the respects of all my family to myself.--There are, sir, said I, ten\n",
      "thousand reasons why I should rejoice in your goodness.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I was going to say, said Mr. Longman, That all your honour's old\n",
      "servants are now happy, but one. You mean John Arnold? said my master. I\n",
      "do, indeed, said he, if you'll excuse me, sir. O, said I, I have had my\n",
      "prayer for poor John answered, as favourably as I could wish.--Why, said\n",
      "Mr. Longman, to be sure poor John has acted no very good part, take it\n",
      "altogether; but he so much honoured you, sir, and so much respected you,\n",
      "madam, that he would have been glad to have been obedient to both; and\n",
      "so was faithful to neither. But, indeed, the poor fellow's heart is\n",
      "almost broke, and he won't look out for any other place; and says,\n",
      "he must live in your honour's service, or he must die wretched very\n",
      "shortly. Mrs. Jervis was there when this was said: Indeed, said she, the\n",
      "poor man has been here every day since he heard the tidings, that have\n",
      "rejoiced us all; and he says, he hopes he shall yet be forgiven. Is he\n",
      "in the house now? said my master. He is, sir; and was here when your\n",
      "honour came in, and played at hide and seek to have one look at you both\n",
      "when you alighted; and was ready to go out of his wits for joy, when we\n",
      "saw your honour hand my lady in. Pamela, said my dear master, you're to\n",
      "do with John as you please. You have full power. Then pray, sir, said I,\n",
      "let poor John come in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor fellow came in, with so much confusion, that I have never seen\n",
      "a countenance that expressed so lively a consciousness of his faults,\n",
      "and mingled joy and shame. How do you do, John? said I; I hope you are\n",
      "very well!--The poor fellow could hardly speak, and looked with awe upon\n",
      "my master, and pleasure upon me. Said my master, Well, John, there is\n",
      "no room to say any thing to a man that has so much concern already: I\n",
      "am told you will serve me whether I will or not; but I turn you over\n",
      "altogether to my spouse here: and she is to do by you as she pleases.\n",
      "You see, John, said I, your good master's indulgence. Well may I\n",
      "forgive, that have so generous an example. I was always persuaded of\n",
      "your honest intentions, if you had known how to distinguish between your\n",
      "duty to your master, and your good-will to me: You will now have no more\n",
      "puzzles on that account, from the goodness of your dear master. I shall\n",
      "be but too happy I said the poor man. God bless your honour! God bless\n",
      "you, madam!--I now have the joy of my soul, in serving you both; and I\n",
      "will make the best of servants, to my power. Well, then, John, said I,\n",
      "your wages will go on, as if you had not left your master: May I not say\n",
      "so, sir? said I. Yes, surely, my dear, replied he; and augment them too,\n",
      "if you find his duty to you deserves it. A thousand millions of thanks,\n",
      "said the poor man: I am very well satisfied, and desire no augmentation.\n",
      "And so he withdrew, overjoyed; and Mrs. Jervis and Mr. Longman were\n",
      "highly pleased; for though they were incensed against him for his\n",
      "fault to me, when matters looked badly for me, yet they, and all his\n",
      "fellow-servants, always loved John.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mr. Longman and Mrs. Jervis had dined, they came in again, to know\n",
      "if he had any commands; and my dear master, filling a glass of wine,\n",
      "said, Longman, I am going to toast the happiest and honestest couple in\n",
      "England, my dear Pamela's father and mother.--Thank you, dear sir, said\n",
      "I.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think, continued he, that little Kentish purchase wants a manager; and\n",
      "as it is a little out of your way, Longman, I have been purposing, if I\n",
      "thought Mr. Andrews would accept it, that he should enter upon Hodge's\n",
      "farm that was, and so manage for me that whole little affair; and we\n",
      "will well stock the farm for him, and make it comfortable; and I think,\n",
      "if he will take that trouble upon him, it will be an ease to you, and a\n",
      "favour to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your honour, said he, cannot do a better thing; and I have had some\n",
      "inkling given me, that you may, if you please, augment that estate, by\n",
      "a purchase, of equal amount, contiguous to it; and as you have so much\n",
      "money to spare, I can't see your honour can do better. Well, said he,\n",
      "let me have the particulars another time, and we will consider about\n",
      "it. But, my dear, added he, you'll mention this to your father, if you\n",
      "please.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have too much money, Longman, continued he, lies useless; though, upon\n",
      "this occasion, I shall not grudge laying out as much in liveries\n",
      "and other things, as if I had married a lady of a fortune equal, if\n",
      "possible, to my Pamela's merit; and I reckon you have a good deal in\n",
      "hand. Yes, sir, said he, more than I wish I had. But I have a mortgage\n",
      "in view, if you don't buy that Kentish thing, that I believe will answer\n",
      "very well; and when matters are riper, will mention it to your honour.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took with me, to Lincolnshire, said my master, upwards of six hundred\n",
      "guineas, and thought to have laid most of them out there: (Thank God,\n",
      "thought I, you did not! for he offered me five hundred of them, you\n",
      "know:) but I have not laid out above two hundred and fifty of them; so\n",
      "two hundred I left there in my escritoire; because I shall go again for\n",
      "a fortnight or so, before winter; and two hundred I have brought with\n",
      "me: and I have money, I know not what, in three places here, the account\n",
      "of which is in my pocket-book, in my library.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have made some little presents, Pamela, to my servants there, on our\n",
      "nuptials; and these two hundred that I have brought up, I will put into\n",
      "your disposal, that, with some of them, you shall do here as you did\n",
      "there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am ashamed, good sir, said I, to be so costly, and so worthless! Pray,\n",
      "my dear, replied he, say not a word of that. Said Mr. Longman, Why,\n",
      "madam, with money in stocks, and one thing or another, his honour could\n",
      "buy half the gentlemen around him. He wants not money, and lays up every\n",
      "year. And it would have been pity but his honour should have wedded\n",
      "just as he has. Very true, Longman, said my master; and, pulling out\n",
      "his purse, said, Tell out, my dear, two hundred guineas, and give me the\n",
      "rest.--I did so. Now, said he, take them yourself, for the purposes I\n",
      "mentioned. But, Mr. Longman, do you, before sunset, bring my dear girl\n",
      "fifty pounds, which is due to her this day, by my promise; and every\n",
      "three months, from this day, pay her fifty pounds; which will be two\n",
      "hundred pounds per annum; and this is for her to lay out at her own\n",
      "discretion, and without account, in such a way as shall derive a\n",
      "blessing upon us all: for she was my mother's almoner, and shall be\n",
      "mine, and her own too.--I'll go for it this instant, said Mr. Longman.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he was done, I looked upon my dear generous master, and on Mrs.\n",
      "Jervis, and he gave me a nod of assent; and I took twenty guineas,\n",
      "and said, Dear Mrs. Jervis, accept of this, which is no more than my\n",
      "generous master ordered me to present to Mrs. Jewkes, for a pair of\n",
      "gloves, on my happy nuptials; and so you, who are much better entitled\n",
      "to them by the love I bear you, must not refuse them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said she, Mrs. Jewkes was on the spot, madam, at the happy time. Yes,\n",
      "said my master; but Pamela would have rejoiced to have had you there\n",
      "instead of her. That I should, sir, replied I, or instead of any body,\n",
      "except my own mother. She gratefully accepted them, and thanked us both:\n",
      "But I don't know what she should thank me for; for I was not worth a\n",
      "fourth of them myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd have you, my dear, said he, in some handsome manner, as you know\n",
      "how, oblige Longman to accept of the like present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Longman returned from his office, and brought me the fifty pounds,\n",
      "saying, I have entered this new article with great pleasure: 'To my Lady\n",
      "fifty pounds: to be paid the same sum quarterly.' O sir! said I,\n",
      "what will become of me, to be so poor in myself, and so rich in your\n",
      "bounty!--It is a shame to take all that your profuse goodness would\n",
      "heap upon me thus: But indeed it shall not be without account.--Make no\n",
      "words, my dear, said he: Are you not my wife? And have I not endowed you\n",
      "with my goods; and, hitherto, this is a very small part.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Longman, said I, and Mrs. Jervis, you both see how I am even\n",
      "oppressed with unreturnable obligations. God bless the donor, and the\n",
      "receiver too! said Mr. Longman: I am sure they will bring back good\n",
      "interest; for, madam, you had ever a bountiful heart; and I have seen\n",
      "the pleasure you used to take to dispense my late lady's alms and\n",
      "donations.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll warrant, Mr. Longman, said I, notwithstanding you are so willing to\n",
      "have me take large sums for nothing at all, I should affront you, if\n",
      "I asked you to accept from me a pair of gloves only, on account of my\n",
      "happy nuptials. He seemed not readily to know how to answer; and my\n",
      "master said, If Longman refuse you, my dear, he may be said to refuse\n",
      "your first favour. On that I put twenty guineas in his hand; but he\n",
      "insisted upon it, that he would take but five. I said, I must desire you\n",
      "to oblige me, Mr. Longman, or I shall think I have affronted you. Well,\n",
      "if I must, said he, I know what I know. What is that, Mr. Longman? said\n",
      "I.--Why, madam, said he, I will not lay it out till my young master's\n",
      "birth-day, which I hope will be within this twelvemonth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not expecting anything like this from the old gentleman, I looked at\n",
      "my master, and then blushed so, I could not hold up my head. Charmingly\n",
      "said, Longman! said my master, and clasped me in his arms: O, my dear\n",
      "life! God send it may be so!--You have quite delighted me, Longman!\n",
      "Though I durst not have said such a thing for the world.--Madam, said\n",
      "the old gentleman, I beg your pardon; I hope no offence: but I'd speak\n",
      "it ten times in a breath to have it so, take it how you please, as long\n",
      "as my good master takes it so well. Mrs. Jervis, said my master, this is\n",
      "an over-nice dear creature; you don't know what a life I have had with\n",
      "her, even on this side matrimony.--Said Mrs. Jervis, I think Mr. Longman\n",
      "says very well; I am sure I shall hope for it too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Longman, who had struck me of a heap, withdrawing soon after, my\n",
      "master said, Why, my dear, you can't look up! The old man said nothing\n",
      "shocking. I did not expect it, though, from him, said I. I was not aware\n",
      "but of some innocent pleasantry. Why, so it was, said he, both innocent\n",
      "and pleasant: and I won't forgive you, if you don't say as he says.\n",
      "Come, speak before Mrs. Jervis. May every thing happen, sir, said I,\n",
      "that will give you delight!--That's my dearest love, said he, and kissed\n",
      "me with great tenderness.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the servants had dined, I desired to see the maidens; and all four\n",
      "came up together. You are welcome home, madam, said Rachel; we rejoice\n",
      "all to see you here, and more to see you our lady. O my good old\n",
      "acquaintances, said I, I joy to see you! How do you do, Rachel? How do\n",
      "you all do? And I took each of them by the hand, and could have kissed\n",
      "them. For, said I to myself, I kissed you all, last time I saw you, in\n",
      "sorrow; why should I not kiss you all with joy? But I forbore, in honour\n",
      "of their master's presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "They seemed quite transported with me: and my good master was pleased\n",
      "with the scene. See here, my lasses, said he, your mistress! I need not\n",
      "bid you respect her; for you always loved her; and she'll have it as\n",
      "much in her power as inclination to be kind to the deserving. Indeed,\n",
      "said I, I shall always be a kind friend to you; and your dear master has\n",
      "ordered me to give each of you this, that you may rejoice with me on my\n",
      "happiness. And so I gave them five guineas a-piece, and said, God bless\n",
      "you every one! I am overjoyed to see you! And they withdrew with the\n",
      "greatest gratitude and pleasure, praying for us both.\n",
      "\n",
      "I turned to my dear master: 'Tis to you, dear sir, said I, next to God,\n",
      "who put it into your generous heart, that all my happiness is owing!\n",
      "That my mind thus overflows with joy and gratitude! And I would have\n",
      "kissed his hand; but he clasped me in his arms, and said, You deserve\n",
      "it, my dear: You deserve it all. Mrs. Jervis came in. Said she, I have\n",
      "seen a very affecting sight; you have made your maidens quite happy,\n",
      "madam, with your kindness and condescension! I saw them all four, as\n",
      "I came by the hall-door, just got up from their knees, praising and\n",
      "praying for you both! Dear good bodies! said I; and did Jane pray too?\n",
      "May their prayers be returned upon themselves, I say!\n",
      "\n",
      "My master sent for Jonathan, and I held up all the fingers of my two\n",
      "hands; and my master giving a nod of approbation as he came in, I said,\n",
      "Well, Mr. Jonathan, I could not be satisfied without seeing you in form,\n",
      "as it were, and thanking you for all your past good-will to me. You'll\n",
      "accept of that, for a pair of gloves, on this happy occasion; and I gave\n",
      "him ten guineas, and took his honest hand between both mine: God bless\n",
      "you, said I, with your silver hairs, so like my dear father!--I shall\n",
      "always value such a good old servant of the best of masters!--He said, O\n",
      "such goodness! Such kind words! It is balm to my heart! Blessed be God\n",
      "I have lived to this day!--And his eyes swam in tears, and he\n",
      "withdrew.--My dear, said my master, you make every one happy!--O, sir,\n",
      "said I, 'tis you, 'tis you! And let my grateful heart always spring to\n",
      "my lips, to acknowledge the blessings you heap upon me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in came Harry, and Isaac, and Benjamin, and the two grooms of this\n",
      "house, and Arthur the gardener; for my dear master had ordered them, by\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis, thus to be marshalled out: and he said, Where's John? Poor\n",
      "John was ashamed, and did not come in till he heard himself called for.\n",
      "I said to them, How do you do, my old friends and fellow-servants? I am\n",
      "glad to see you all.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master said, I have given you a mistress, my lads, that is the joy of\n",
      "my heart: You see her goodness and condescension! Let your respects to\n",
      "her be but answerable, and she'll be proportionately as great a blessing\n",
      "to you all, as she is to me. Harry said, In the names of all your\n",
      "servants, sir, I bless your honour, and your good lady: and it shall\n",
      "be all our studies to deserve her ladyship's favours, as well as your\n",
      "honour's. And so I gave every one five guineas, to rejoice, as I said,\n",
      "in my happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I came to John, I said, I saw you before, John; but I again tell\n",
      "you, I am glad to see you. He said, he was quite ashamed and confounded.\n",
      "O, said I, forget every thing that's past, John!--Your dear good master\n",
      "will, and so will I. For God has wonderfully brought about all these\n",
      "things, by the very means I once thought most grievous. Let us,\n",
      "therefore, look forward, and be only ashamed to commit faults for\n",
      "the time to come: for they may not always be attended with like happy\n",
      "consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur, said my master, I have brought you a mistress that is a great\n",
      "gardener. She'll shew you a new way to plant beans: And never any body\n",
      "had such a hand at improving a sun-flower as she!--O sir, sir, said I,\n",
      "(but yet a little dashed,) all my improvements in every kind of thing\n",
      "are owing to you, I am sure!--And so I think I was even with the dear\n",
      "man, and yet appeared grateful before his servants. They withdrew,\n",
      "blessing us both, as the rest had done. And then came in the postilion,\n",
      "and two helpers, (for my master has both here, and at Lincolnshire, fine\n",
      "hunting horses; and it is the chief sport he takes delight in,) as also\n",
      "the scullion-boy: And I said, How do all of you? And how dost do, Tommy?\n",
      "I hope you're very good. Here your dear master has ordered you something\n",
      "a-piece, in honour of me. And my master holding three fingers to me, I\n",
      "gave the postilion and helpers three guineas each, and the little boy\n",
      "two; and bid him let his poor mother lay it out for him, for he must not\n",
      "spend it idly. Mr. Colbrand, Abraham, and Thomas, I had before presented\n",
      "at t'other house.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when they were all gone but Mrs. Jervis, I said, And now, dearest\n",
      "sir, permit me, on my knees, thus to bless you, and pray for you. And\n",
      "oh, may God crown you with length of days, and increase of honour;\n",
      "and may your happy, happy Pamela, by her grateful heart, appear always\n",
      "worthy in your dear eyes, though she cannot be so in her own, nor in\n",
      "those of any others!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jervis, said my master, you see the excellency of this sweet\n",
      "creature! And when I tell you that the charms of her person, all lovely\n",
      "as she is, bind me not so strongly to her, as the graces of her mind;\n",
      "congratulate me, that my happiness is built on so stable a basis. Indeed\n",
      "I do, most sincerely, sir, said she: This is a happy day to me!\n",
      "\n",
      "I stept into the library, while he was thus pouring out his kindness for\n",
      "me to Mrs. Jervis; and blessed God there on my knees, for the difference\n",
      "I now found to what I had once known in it.--And when I have done the\n",
      "same in the first scene of my fears, the once frightful summer-house,\n",
      "I shall have gone through most of my distressful scenes with gratitude;\n",
      "but shall never forbear thanking God in my mind, for his goodness to\n",
      "me in every one. Mrs. Jervis, I find, had whispered him what I had done\n",
      "above, and he saw me upon my knees, with my back towards him, unknown to\n",
      "me; but softly put to the door again, as he had opened it a little way.\n",
      "And I said, not knowing he had seen me, You have some charming pictures\n",
      "here, sir.--Yes, said he, my dear life, so I have; but none equal to\n",
      "that which your piety affords me; And may the God you delight to\n",
      "serve, bless more and more my dear angel!--Sir, said I, you are all\n",
      "goodness!--I hope, replied he, after your sweet example, I shall be\n",
      "better and better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you think, my dear father and mother, there ever was so happy a\n",
      "creature as I? To be sure it would be very ungrateful to think with\n",
      "uneasiness, or any thing but compassion, of poor Miss Sally Godfrey.\n",
      "\n",
      "He ordered Jonathan to let the evening be passed merrily, but wisely, as\n",
      "he said, with what every one liked, whether wine or October.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was pleased afterwards to lead me up stairs, and gave me possession\n",
      "of my lady's dressing-room and cabinet, and her fine repeating-watch and\n",
      "equipage; and, in short, of a complete set of diamonds, that were his\n",
      "good mother's; as also of the two pair of diamond ear-rings, the\n",
      "two diamond rings, and diamond necklace, he mentioned in his naughty\n",
      "articles, which her ladyship had intended for presents to Miss Tomlins,\n",
      "a rich heiress, that was proposed for his wife, when he was just come\n",
      "from his travels; but which went off, after all was agreed upon on both\n",
      "the friends' sides, because he approved not her conversation; and she\n",
      "had, as he told his mother, too masculine an air; and he never could\n",
      "be brought to see her but once, though the lady liked him very well.\n",
      "He presented me also with her ladyship's books, pictures, linen, laces,\n",
      "etc. that were in her apartments; and bid me call those apartments mine.\n",

      "Sunday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "This day, as matters could not be ready for our appearance at a better\n",
      "place, we staid at home; and my dear master employed himself a good deal\n",
      "in his library: And I have been taken up pretty much, I hope, as I ought\n",
      "to be, in thankfulness, prayer and meditation, in my newly-presented\n",
      "closet And I hope God will be pleased to give a blessing to me; for\n",
      "I have the pleasure to think I am not puffed up with this great\n",
      "alteration; and yet am I not wanting to look upon all these favours\n",
      "and blessings in the light wherein I ought to receive them, both at the\n",
      "hands of Heaven, and my dear benefactor.\n",
      "\n",
      "We dined together with great pleasure; and I had, in every word and\n",
      "action, all the instances of kindness and affection that the most\n",
      "indulged heart could wish. He said he would return to his closet again;\n",
      "and at five o'clock would come and take a walk with me in the garden:\n",
      "And so retired as soon as he had dined, and I went up to mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "About six, he was pleased to come up to me, and said, Now, my dear, I\n",
      "will attend you for a little walk in the garden; and I gave him my hand\n",
      "with great pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "This garden is much better cultivated than the Lincolnshire one; but\n",
      "that is larger, and has nobler walks in it; and yet there is a pretty\n",
      "canal in this, and a fountain and cascade. We had a deal of sweet\n",
      "conversation as we walked; and, after we had taken a turn round, I bent\n",
      "towards the little garden; and when I came near the summer-house, took\n",
      "the opportunity to slip from him, and just whipt up the steps of this\n",
      "once frightful place, and kneeled down, and said, I bless thee, O God!\n",
      "for my escapes, and for thy mercies! O let me always possess a grateful,\n",
      "humble heart! and I whipt down again and joined him; and he hardly\n",
      "missed me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several of the neighbouring gentry sent their compliments to him on his\n",
      "return, but not a word about his marriage; particularly Mr. Arthur, Mr.\n",

      "was so kind to pick out six of the richest for me to choose three suits\n",
      "out of, saying, We would furnish ourselves with more in town, when we\n",
      "went thither. One was white, flowered with silver most richly; and he\n",
      "was pleased to say, that, as I was a bride, I should make my appearance\n",
      "in that the following Sunday. And so we shall have in two or three days,\n",
      "from several places, nothing but mantua-makers and tailors at work.\n",
      "Bless me! what a chargeable and what a worthless hussy I am to the dear\n",
      "gentleman!--But his fortune and station require a great deal of it;\n",
      "and his value for me will not let him do less, than if he had married a\n",
      "fortune equal to his own: and then, as he says, it would be a reflection\n",
      "upon him, if he did.--And so I doubt it will be, as it is: For either\n",
      "way the world will have something to say. He made me also choose some\n",
      "very fine laces, and linen; and has sent a message on purpose, with his\n",
      "orders, to hasten all down, what can be done in town, as the millinery\n",
      "matters, etc. to be completed there, and sent by particular messengers,\n",

      "fail.\n",

      "finest cloth for you, my dear father; and of a creditable silk for my\n",

      "On Tuesday morning, my dear sir rode out, and brought with him to\n",
      "dinner, Mr. Martin of the Grove, and Mr. Arthur, and Mr. Brooks, and one\n",
      "Mr. Chambers; and he stept up to me, and said he had rode out too far\n",
      "to return to breakfast; but he had brought with him some of his old\n",
      "acquaintance, to dine with me. Are you sorry for it, Pamela? said he. I\n",
      "remembered his lessons, and said No, sure, sir; I cannot be angry at any\n",
      "thing you are pleased to do. Said he, You know Mr. Martin's character,\n",
      "and have severely censured him in one of your letters, as one of my\n",
      "brother rakes, and for his three lyings-in.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then gave me the following account, how he came to bring them. Said\n",
      "he, 'I met them all at Mr. Arthur's; and his lady asked me, if I was\n",
      "really married? I said, Yes, really. And to whom? said Mr. Martin. Why,\n",
      "replied I, bluntly, to my mother's waiting-maid. They could not tell\n",
      "what to say to me hereupon, and looked one upon another. And I saw I had\n",
      "spoiled a jest, from each. Mrs. Arthur said, You have, indeed, sir, a\n",
      "charming creature, as ever I saw; and she has mighty good luck. Ay, said\n",
      "I, and so have I. But I shall say the less, because a man never did any\n",
      "thing of this nature, that he did not think he ought, if it were but\n",
      "in policy, to make the best of it. Nay, said Mr. Arthur, if you have\n",
      "sinned, it is with your eyes open: for you know the world as well as any\n",
      "gentleman of your years in it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why, really, gentlemen, said I, I should be glad to please all my\n",
      "friends; but I can't expect, till they know my motives and inducements,\n",
      "that it will be so immediately. But I do assure you, I am exceedingly\n",
      "pleased myself; and that, you know, is most to the purpose.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Said Mr. Brooks, I have heard my wife praise your spouse that is, so\n",
      "much for person and beauty, that I wanted to see her of all things. Why,\n",
      "replied I, if you'll all go and take a dinner with me, you shall see\n",
      "her with all my heart. And, Mrs. Arthur, will you bear us company? No,\n",
      "indeed, sir, said she. What, I'll warrant, my wife will not be able to\n",
      "reconcile you to my mother's waiting-maid; is not that it? Tell truth,\n",
      "Mrs. Arthur. Nay, said she, I shan't be backward to pay your spouse a\n",
      "visit, in company of the neighbouring ladies; but for one single woman\n",
      "to go, on such a sudden motion too, with so many gentlemen, is not\n",
      "right. But that need not hinder you, gentlemen. So, said he, the rest\n",
      "sent, that they should not dine at home; and they and Mr. Chambers, a\n",
      "gentleman lately settled in these parts, one and all came with me: And\n",
      "so, my dear, concluded he, when you make your appearance next Sunday,\n",
      "you're sure of a party in your favour; for all that see you must esteem\n",
      "you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He went to them; and when I came down to dinner, he was pleased to take\n",
      "me by the hand, at my entrance into the parlour, and said, My dear, I\n",
      "have brought some of my good neighbours to dine with you. I said, You\n",
      "are very good, sir.--My dear, this gentleman is Mr. Chambers; and so he\n",
      "presented every one to me; and they saluted me, and wished us both joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I, for my part, said Mr. Brooks, wish you joy most heartily. My wife\n",
      "told me a good deal of the beauties of your person; but I did not think\n",
      "we had such a flower in our country. Sir, said I, your lady is very\n",
      "partial to me; and you are so polite a gentleman, that you will not\n",
      "contradict your good lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll assure you, madam, returned he, you have not hit the matter at all;\n",
      "for we contradict one another twice or thrice a day. But the devil's\n",
      "in't if we are not agreed in so clear a case!\n",
      "\n",
      "Said Mr. Martin, Mr. Brooks says very true, madam, in both respects;\n",
      "(meaning his wife's and his own contradiction to one another, as well as\n",
      "in my favour;) for, added he, they have been married some years.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I had not the best opinion of this gentleman, nor his jest, I said,\n",
      "I am almost sorry, sir, for the gentleman's jest upon himself and his\n",
      "lady; but I think it should have relieved him from a greater jest, your\n",
      "pleasant confirmation of it.--But still the reason you give that it may\n",
      "be so, I hope, is the reason that may be given that it is not so; to\n",
      "wit, that they have been married some years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said Mr. Arthur, Mr. Martin, I think the lady has very handsomely\n",
      "reproved you. I think so too, said Mr. Chambers; and it was but a very\n",
      "indifferent compliment to a bride. Said Mr. Martin, Compliment or not,\n",
      "gentlemen, I have never seen a matrimony of any time standing, that it\n",
      "was not so, little or much: But I dare say it will never be so here.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, sir, said I, if it was, I must be the ungratefullest person\n",
      "in the world, because I am the most obliged person in it. That notion,\n",
      "said Mr. Arthur, is so excellent, that it gives a moral certainty it\n",
      "never can.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said Mr. Brooks to my dear master, softly, You have a most\n",
      "accomplished lady, I do assure you, as well in her behaviour and wit,\n",
      "as in her person, call her what you please. Why, my dear friend, said my\n",
      "master, I must tell you, as I have said before now, that her person made\n",
      "me her lover, but her mind made her my wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first course coming in, my dear sir led me himself to my place; and\n",
      "set Mr. Chambers, as the greatest stranger, at my right hand, and Mr.\n",
      "Brooks at my left; and Mr. Arthur was pleased to observe, much to my\n",
      "advantage, on the ease and freedom with which I behaved myself, and\n",
      "helped them; and said, he would bring his lady to be a witness, and a\n",
      "learner both, of my manners. I said, I should be proud of any honour\n",
      "Mrs. Arthur would vouchsafe to do me; and if once I could promise myself\n",
      "the opportunity of his good lady's example, and those of the other\n",
      "gentlemen present, I should have the greater opinion of my worthiness to\n",
      "sit in the place I filled at present with much insufficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Arthur drank to my health and happiness, and said, My wife told your\n",
      "spouse, madam, you had very good luck in such a husband; but I now\n",
      "see who has the best of it. Said Mr. Brooks, Come, come, let's make no\n",
      "compliments; for the plain truth of the matter is, our good neighbour's\n",
      "generosity and judgment have met with so equal a match in his lady's\n",
      "beauty and merit, that I know not which has the best luck. But may you\n",
      "be both long happy together, say I! And so he drank a glass of wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "My best friend, who always takes delight to have me praised, seemed much\n",
      "pleased with our conversation; and he said the kindest, tenderest, and\n",
      "most respectful things in the world to me. Insomuch, that the rough\n",
      "Mr. Martin said, Did you ever think our good friend here, who used to\n",
      "ridicule matrimony so much, would have made so complaisant a husband?\n",
      "How long do you intend, sir, that this shall hold? As long as my good\n",
      "girl deserves it, said he; and that, I hope, will be for ever. But,\n",
      "continued the kind gentleman, you need not wonder I have changed my mind\n",
      "as to wedlock; for I never expected to meet with one whose behaviour and\n",
      "sweetness of temper were so well adapted to make me happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner, and having drank good healths to each of their ladies, I\n",
      "withdrew; and they sat and drank two bottles of claret a-piece, and were\n",
      "very merry; and went away, full of my praises, and vowing to bring their\n",
      "ladies to see me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "John having brought me your kind letter, my dear father, I told my good\n",
      "master, after his friends were gone, how gratefully you received his\n",
      "generous intentions as to the Kentish farm, and promised your best\n",
      "endeavours to serve him in that estate; and that you hoped your industry\n",
      "and care would be so well employed in it, that you should be very little\n",
      "troublesome to him,--as to the liberal manner in which he had intended\n",
      "to add to a provision, that of itself exceeded all you wished. He was\n",
      "very well pleased with your cheerful acceptance of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am glad your engagements in the world lie in so small a compass. As\n",
      "soon as you have gotten an account of them exactly, you will be pleased\n",
      "to send it me, with the list of the poor folks you are so kind to\n",
      "promise to procure me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think, as my dear master is so generous, you should account nothing\n",
      "that is plain, too good. Pray don't be afraid of laying out upon\n",
      "yourselves. My dear sir intends that you shall not, when you come to us,\n",
      "return to your old abode; but stay with us, till you set out for Kent;\n",
      "and so you must dispose of yourselves accordingly. And I hope, my dear\n",
      "father, you have quite left off all slavish business. As farmer Jones\n",
      "has been kind to you, as I have heard you say, pray, when you take leave\n",
      "of them, present them with three guineas worth of good books; such as\n",
      "a family bible, a common prayer, a whole duty of man, or any other you\n",
      "think will be acceptable; for they live a great way from church; and in\n",
      "winter the ways from their farm thither are impassable.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has brought me my papers safe: and I will send them to Lady Davers\n",
      "the first opportunity, down to the place I mentioned in my last.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear Mr. B---- just now tells me, that he will carry me, in the\n",
      "morning, a little airing, about ten miles off, in his chariot and four,\n",
      "to breakfast at a farm-house, noted for a fine dairy, and where, now and\n",
      "then, the neighbouring gentry, of both sexes, resort for that purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "We set out at about half an hour after six, accordingly; and driving\n",
      "pretty smartly, got at this truly neat house at half an hour after\n",
      "eight; and I was much pleased with the neatness of the good woman, and\n",
      "her daughter and maid; and he was so good as to say he would now and\n",
      "then take a turn with me to the same place, and on the same occasion, as\n",
      "I seemed to like it; for that it would be a pretty exercise, and procure\n",
      "us appetites to our breakfasts, as well as our return would to our\n",
      "dinners. But I find this was not, though a very good reason, the only\n",
      "one for which he gave me this agreeable airing; as I shall acquaint you.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were prettily received and entertained here, and an elegancy ran\n",
      "through every thing, persons as well as furniture, yet all plain. And my\n",
      "master said to the good housewife, Do your young boarding-school ladies\n",
      "still at times continue their visits to you, Mrs. Dobson? Yes, sir, said\n",
      "she, I expect three or four of them every minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is, my dear, said he, within three miles of this farm, a very good\n",
      "boarding-school for ladies. The governess of it keeps a chaise and pair,\n",
      "which is to be made a double chaise at pleasure; and in summer time,\n",
      "when the misses perform their tasks to satisfaction, she favours them\n",
      "with an airing to this place, three or four at a time; and after they\n",
      "have breakfasted, they are carried back. And this serves both for a\n",
      "reward, and for exercise; and the misses who have this favour are not\n",
      "a little proud of it; and it brings them forward in their respective\n",
      "tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very good method, sir, said I. And just as we were talking, the chaise\n",
      "came in with four misses, all pretty much of a size, and a maid-servant\n",
      "to attend them. They were shewn another little neat apartment, that went\n",
      "through ours; and made their honours very prettily, as they passed by\n",
      "us. I went into the room to them, and asked them questions about their\n",
      "work, and their lessons; and what they had done to deserve such a fine\n",
      "airing and breakfasting; and they all answered me very prettily. And\n",
      "pray, little ladies, said I, what may I call your names? One was called\n",
      "Miss Burdoff, one Miss Nugent, one Miss Booth, and the fourth Miss\n",
      "Goodwin. I don't know which, said I, is the prettiest; but you are all\n",
      "best, my little dears; and you have a very good governess, to indulge\n",
      "you with such a fine airing, and such delicate cream, and bread and\n",
      "butter. I hope you think so too.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master came in, and I had no mistrust in the world; and he kissed\n",
      "each of them; but looked more wishfully on Miss Goodwin, than on any of\n",
      "the others; but I thought nothing just then: Had she been called Miss\n",
      "Godfrey, I had hit upon it in a trice.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we went from them, he said, Which do you think the prettiest of\n",
      "those misses? Really, sir, replied I, it is hard to say: Miss Booth is a\n",
      "pretty brown girl, and has a fine eye; Miss Burdoff has a great deal\n",
      "of sweetness in her countenance, but is not so regularly featured. Miss\n",
      "Nugent is very fair: and Miss Goodwin has a fine black eye, and is,\n",
      "besides, I think, the genteelest shaped child; but they are all pretty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The maid led them into the garden, to shew them the beehives; and Miss\n",
      "Goodwin made a particular fine courtesy to my master; and I said, I\n",
      "believe miss knows you, sir; and, taking her by the hand, I said, Do you\n",
      "know this gentleman, my pretty dear?--Yes, madam, said she; it is my own\n",
      "dear uncle. I clasped her in my arms: O why did you not tell me, sir,\n",
      "said I, that you had a niece among these little ladies? And I kissed\n",
      "her, and away she tript after the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "But pray, sir, said I, how can this be?--You have no sister nor brother,\n",
      "but Lady Davers.--How can this be?\n",
      "\n",
      "He smiled: and then I said, O my dearest sir, tell me now the truth,\n",
      "Does not this pretty miss stand in a nearer relation to you, than as\n",
      "a niece?--I know she does! I know she does! And I embraced him as he\n",
      "stood.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tis even so, my dear, replied he; and you remember my sister's\n",
      "good-natured hint of Miss Sally Godfrey? I do well, sir, answered I.\n",
      "But this is Miss Goodwin. Her mother chose that name for her, said he,\n",
      "because she should not be called by her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said I, excuse me, sir; I must go and have a little prattle\n",
      "with her. I'll send for her in again, replied he; and in she came in a\n",
      "moment. I took her in my arms, and said, O my charming dear! will you\n",
      "love me?--Will you let me be your aunt? Yes, madam, answered she, with\n",
      "all my heart! and I will love you dearly: But I mustn't love my uncle.\n",
      "Why so? said he. Because, replied she, you would not speak to me at\n",
      "first! And because you would not let me call you uncle (for it seems she\n",
      "was bid not, that I might not guess at her presently): and yet, said the\n",
      "pretty dear, I had not seen you a great while, so I hadn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Pamela, said he, now can you allow me to love this little\n",
      "innocent? Allow you, sir, replied I; you would be very barbarous, if you\n",
      "did not; and I should be more so, if I did not further it all I could,\n",
      "and love the little lamb myself, for your sake and for her own sake; and\n",
      "in compassion to her poor mother, though unknown to me: And tears stood\n",
      "in my eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said he, Why, my love, are your words so kind, and your countenance so\n",
      "sad?--I drew to the window from the child; and said, Sad it is not, sir;\n",
      "but I have a strange grief and pleasure mingled at once in my breast, on\n",
      "this occasion. It is indeed a twofold grief, and a twofold pleasure.--As\n",
      "how, my dear? said he. Why, sir, replied I, I cannot help being grieved\n",
      "for the poor mother of this sweet babe, to think, if she be living, that\n",
      "she must call her chiefest delight her shame: If she be no more, that\n",
      "she must have had such remorse on her poor mind, when she came to leave\n",
      "the world, and her little babe: And, in the second place, I grieve, that\n",
      "it must be thought a kindness to the dear little soul, not to let\n",
      "her know how near the dearest relation she has in the world is to\n",
      "her.--Forgive me, dear sir, I say not this to reproach you, in the\n",
      "least. Indeed I don't. And I have a twofold cause of joy; first, That\n",
      "I have had the grace to escape the like unhappiness with this poor\n",
      "gentlewoman: and next, That this discovery has given me an opportunity\n",
      "to shew the sincerity of my grateful affection for you, sir, in the love\n",
      "I will always express to this dear child.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then I stept to her again, and kissed her; and said, Join with me,\n",
      "my pretty love, to beg your dear uncle to let you come and live with\n",
      "your new aunt: Indeed, my little precious, I'll love you dearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will you, sir? said the little charmer; will you let me go and live with\n",
      "my aunt?\n",
      "\n",
      "You are very good, my Pamela, said he. And I have not once been deceived\n",
      "in the hopes my fond heart has entertained of your prudence.--But will\n",
      "you, sir? said I; will you grant me this favour? I shall most sincerely\n",
      "love the little charmer; and all I am capable of doing for her, both\n",
      "by example and affection, shall most cordially be done. My dearest sir,\n",
      "added I, oblige me in this thing! I think already my heart is set upon\n",
      "it! What a sweet employment and companionship shall I have!\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll talk of this some other time, replied he; but I must, in prudence,\n",
      "put some bounds to your amiable generosity. I had always intended to\n",
      "surprise you into this discovery; but my sister led the way to it, out\n",
      "of a poorness in her spite, that I could not brook: And though you have\n",
      "pleased me beyond expression, in your behaviour on this occasion; yet\n",
      "I can't say, that you have gone much beyond my expectations; for I have\n",
      "such a high opinion of you, that I think nothing could have shaken\n",
      "it, but a contrary conduct to this you have expressed on so tender a\n",
      "circumstance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, sir, said the dear little miss, then you will not let me go home\n",
      "with my aunt, will you? I am sure she will love me. When you break up\n",
      "next, my dear, said he, if you are a good girl, you shall pay your new\n",
      "aunt a visit. She made a low courtesy. Thank you, sir, answered she.\n",
      "Yes, my dear, said I, and I will get you some fine things against the\n",
      "time. I would have brought you some now, had I known I should have seen\n",
      "my pretty love. Thank you, madam, returned she.\n",
      "\n",
      "How old, sir, said I, is miss? Between six and seven, answered he. Was\n",
      "she ever, sir, said I, at your house? My sister, replied he, carried her\n",
      "thither once, as a near relation of her lord's. I remember, sir, said I,\n",
      "a little miss; and Mrs. Jervis and I took her to be a relation of Lord\n",
      "Davers.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister, returned he, knew the whole secret from the beginning; and it\n",
      "made her a great merit with me, that she kept it from the knowledge\n",
      "of my father, who was then living, and of my mother, to her dying-day;\n",
      "though she descended so low in her rage, to hint the matter to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little misses took their leaves soon after: and I know not how, but\n",
      "I am strangely affected with this dear child. I wish he would be so good\n",
      "as to let me have her home. It would be a great pleasure to have such\n",
      "a fine opportunity, obliged as I am, to shew my love for himself, in my\n",
      "fondness for his dear miss.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we came home together in the chariot, he gave me the following\n",
      "particulars of this affair, additional to what he had before mentioned:\n",
      "\n",
      "That this lady was of a good family, and the flower of it but that her\n",
      "mother was a person of great art and address, and not altogether so nice\n",
      "in the particular between himself and miss, as she ought to have been:\n",
      "That, particularly, when she had reason to find him unsettled and wild,\n",
      "and her daughter in more danger from him, than he was from her, yet she\n",
      "encouraged their privacies; and even, at last, when she had reason\n",
      "to apprehend, from their being surprised together, in a way not so\n",
      "creditable to the lady, that she was far from forbidding their private\n",
      "meetings; on the contrary, that, on a certain time, she had set one that\n",
      "had formerly been her footman, and a half-pay officer, her relation, to\n",
      "watch an opportunity, and to frighten him into a marriage with the lady:\n",
      "That, accordingly, when they had surprised him in her chamber, just\n",
      "as he had been let in, they drew their swords upon him, and threatened\n",
      "instantly to kill him, if he did not promise marriage on the spot; and\n",
      "that they had a parson ready below stairs, as he found afterwards: That\n",
      "then he suspected, from some strong circumstances, that miss was in the\n",
      "plot; which so enraged him, with their menaces together, that he drew,\n",
      "and stood upon his defence; and was so much in earnest, that the man he\n",
      "pushed into the arm, and disabled; and pressing pretty forward upon\n",
      "the other, as he retreated, he rushed in upon him near the top of the\n",
      "stairs, and pushed him down one pair, and he was much hurt by the fall:\n",
      "Not but that, he said, he might have paid for his rashness; but that\n",
      "the business of his antagonists was rather to frighten than to kill\n",
      "him: That, upon this, in the sight of the old lady, the parson she had\n",
      "provided, and her other daughters, he went out of their house, with\n",
      "bitter execrations against them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "That after this, designing to break off all correspondence with the\n",
      "whole family, and miss too, she found means to engage him to give her\n",
      "a meeting at Woodstock, in order to clear herself: That, poor lady! she\n",
      "was there obliged, naughty creature as he was! to make herself quite\n",
      "guilty of a worse fault, in order to clear herself of a lighter:\n",
      "That they afterwards met at Godstow often, at Woodstock, and every\n",
      "neighbouring place to Oxford, where he was then studying, as it proved,\n",
      "guilty lessons, instead of improving ones; till, at last, the effect\n",
      "of their frequent interviews grew too obvious to be concealed: That the\n",
      "young lady then, when she was not fit to be seen, for the credit of the\n",
      "family, was confined, and all manner of means were used, to induce him\n",
      "to marry her: That, finding nothing would do, they at last resolved\n",
      "to complain to his father and mother; but that he made his sister\n",
      "acquainted with the matter, who then happened to be at home; and, by her\n",
      "management and spirit, their intentions of that sort were frustrated;\n",
      "and, seeing no hopes, they agreed to Lady Davers's proposals, and sent\n",
      "poor miss down to Marlborough, where, at her expense, which he answered\n",
      "to her again, she was provided for, and privately lay-in: That Lady\n",
      "Davers took upon herself the care of the little one, till it came to be\n",
      "fit to be put to the boarding-school, where it now is: And that he had\n",
      "settled upon the dear little miss such a sum of money, as the interest\n",
      "of it would handsomely provide for her: and the principal would be\n",
      "a tolerable fortune, fit for a gentlewoman, when she came to be\n",
      "marriageable. And this, my dear, said he, is the story in brief. And\n",
      "I do assure you, Pamela, added he, I am far from making a boast of, or\n",
      "taking a pride in, this affair: But since it has happened, I can't say\n",
      "but I wish the poor child to live, and be happy; and I must endeavour to\n",
      "make her so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, said I, to be sure you should; and I shall take a very great pride\n",
      "to contribute to the dear little soul's felicity, if you will permit me\n",
      "to have her home.--But, added I, does miss know any thing who are her\n",
      "father and mother? I wanted him to say if the poor lady was living or\n",
      "dead.--No, answered he. Her governess has been told, by my sister, that\n",
      "she is the daughter of a gentleman and his lady, who are related, at\n",
      "a distance, to Lord Davers, and now live in Jamaica; and she calls me\n",
      "uncle, only because I am the brother to Lady Davers, whom she calls\n",
      "aunt, and who is very fond of her: as is also my lord, who knows the\n",
      "whole matter; and they have her, at all her little school recesses, at\n",
      "their house, and are very kind to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe, added he, the truth of the matter is very little known\n",
      "or suspected; for, as her mother is of no mean family, her friends\n",
      "endeavour to keep it secret, as much as I: and Lady Davers, till her\n",
      "wrath boiled over, t'other day, has managed the matter very dexterously\n",
      "and kindly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The words, mother is of no mean family, gave me not to doubt the poor\n",
      "lady was living. And I said, But how, sir, can the dear miss's poor\n",
      "mother be content to deny herself the enjoyment of so sweet a child?\n",
      "Ah, Pamela, replied he, now you come in; I see you want to know what's\n",
      "become of the poor mother. 'Tis natural enough you should; but I was\n",
      "willing to see how the little suspense would operate upon you.--Dear\n",
      "sir, said I.--Nay, replied he, 'tis very natural, my dear! I think you\n",
      "have had a great deal of patience, and are come at this question so\n",
      "fairly that you deserve to be answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must know then, there is some foundation for saying, that her\n",
      "mother, at least, lives in Jamaica; for there she does live, and very\n",
      "happily too. For I must observe, that she suffered so much in child-bed,\n",
      "that nobody expected her life; and this, when she was up, made such an\n",
      "impression upon her, that she dreaded nothing so much as the thoughts of\n",
      "returning to her former fault; and, to say the truth, I had intended to\n",
      "make her a visit as soon as her month was well up. And so, unknown to\n",
      "me, she engaged herself to go to Jamaica, with two young ladies, who\n",
      "were born there; and were returning to their friends, after they had\n",
      "been four years in England for their education: and, recommending to me,\n",
      "by a very moving letter, her little baby, and that I would not suffer it\n",
      "to be called by her name, but Goodwin, that her shame might be the less\n",
      "known, for hers and her family's sake; she got her friends to assign\n",
      "her five hundred pounds, in full of all her demands upon her family, and\n",
      "went up to London, and embarked, with her companions, at Gravesend,\n",
      "and so sailed to Jamaica; where she is since well and happily married,\n",
      "passing to her husband for a young widow, with one daughter, which her\n",
      "husband's friends take care of, and provide for. And so you see, Pamela,\n",
      "that in the whole story on both sides, the truth is as much preserved as\n",
      "possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor lady! said I; how her story moves me! I am glad she is so happy\n",
      "at last!--And, my dear, said he, are you not glad she is so far off\n",
      "too?--As to that, sir, said I, I cannot be sorry, to be sure, as she\n",
      "is so happy; which she could not have been here. For, sir, I doubt you\n",
      "would have proceeded with your temptations, if she had not gone; and\n",
      "it shewed she was much in earnest to be good, that she could leave her\n",
      "native country, leave all her relations, leave you, whom she so well\n",
      "loved, leave her dear baby, and try a new fortune, in a new world, among\n",
      "quite strangers, and hazard the seas; and all to preserve herself from\n",
      "further guiltiness! Indeed, indeed, sir, said I, I bleed for what\n",
      "her distresses must be, in this case I am grieved for her poor mind's\n",
      "remorse, through her childbed terrors, which could have so great and so\n",
      "worthy an effect upon her afterwards; and I honour her resolution; and\n",
      "would rank such a returning dear lady in the class of those who are\n",
      "most virtuous; and doubt not God Almighty's mercy to her; and that her\n",
      "present happiness is the result of his gracious providence, blessing her\n",
      "penitence and reformation.--But, sir, said I, did you not once see the\n",
      "poor lady after her lying-in?\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not believe her so much in earnest, answered he; and I went down\n",
      "to Marlborough, and heard she was gone from thence to Calne. I went to\n",
      "Calne, and heard she was gone to Reading, to a relation's there. Thither\n",
      "I went, and heard she was gone to Oxford. I followed; and there she was;\n",
      "but I could not see her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She at last received a letter from me, begging a meeting with her; for\n",
      "I found her departure with the ladies was resolved on, and that she was\n",
      "with her friends, only to take leave of them, and receive her agreed\n",
      "on portion: And she appointed the Saturday following, and that was\n",
      "Wednesday, to give me a meeting at the old place, at Woodstock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, added he, I thought I was sure of her, and doubted not I should\n",
      "spoil her intended voyage. I set out on Thursday to Gloucester, on a\n",
      "party of pleasure; and on Saturday I went to the place appointed, at\n",
      "Woodstock: But when I came thither, I found a letter instead of my\n",
      "lady; and when I opened it, it was to beg my pardon for deceiving me;\n",
      "expressing her concern for her past fault; her affection for me; and\n",
      "the apprehension she had, that she should be unable to keep her good\n",
      "resolves, if she met me: that she had set out on the Thursday for her\n",
      "embarkation; for that she feared nothing else could save her; and had\n",
      "appointed this meeting on Saturday, at the place of her former guilt,\n",
      "that I might be suitably impressed upon the occasion, and pity and allow\n",
      "for her; and that she might get three or four days start of me, and be\n",
      "quite out of my reach. She recommended again, as upon the spot where the\n",
      "poor little one owed its being, my tenderness to it, for her sake; and\n",
      "that was all she had to request of me, she said; but would not forget\n",
      "to pray for me in all her own dangers, and in every difficulty she was\n",
      "going to encounter.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wept at this moving tale. And did not this make a deep impression upon\n",
      "you, sir? said I. Surely such an affecting lesson as this, on the very\n",
      "guilty spot too, (I admire the dear lady's pious contrivance!) must have\n",
      "had a great effect upon you. One would have thought, sir, it was enough\n",
      "to reclaim you for ever! All your naughty purposes, I make no doubt,\n",
      "were quite changed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, my dear, said he, I was much moved, you may be sure, when I came to\n",
      "reflect: But, at first, I was so assured of being a successful tempter,\n",
      "and spoiling her voyage, that I was vexed, and much out of humour;\n",
      "but when I came to reflect, as I said, I was quite overcome with this\n",
      "instance of her prudence, her penitence, and her resolution; and more\n",
      "admired her than I ever had done. Yet I could not bear she should so\n",
      "escape me neither; so much overcome me, as it were, in an heroical\n",
      "bravery; and I hastened away, and got a bill of credit of Lord Davers,\n",
      "upon his banker in London, for five hundred pounds; and set out for that\n",
      "place, having called at Oxford, and got what light I could, as to where\n",
      "I might hear of her there.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I arrived in town, which was not till Monday morning, I went to a\n",
      "place called Crosby-square, where the friends of the two ladies lived.\n",
      "She had set out in the flying-coach on Tuesday; got to the two ladies\n",
      "that very night; and, on Saturday, had set out with them for Gravesend,\n",
      "much about the time I was expecting her at Woodstock.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may suppose that I was much affected, my dear, with this. However,\n",
      "I got my bill of credit converted into money; and I set out with my\n",
      "servant on Monday afternoon, and reached Gravesend that night; and there\n",
      "I understood that she and the two ladies had gone on board from the very\n",
      "inn I put up at, in the morning; and the ship waited only for the wind,\n",
      "which then was turning about in its favour.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got a boat directly, and went on board the ship, and asked for Mrs.\n",
      "Godfrey. But judge you, my dear Pamela, her surprise and confusion, when\n",
      "she saw me! She had like to have fainted away. I offered any money to\n",
      "put off the sailing till next day, but it would not be complied with;\n",
      "and fain would I have got her on shore, and promised to attend her, if\n",
      "she would go over land, to any part of England the ship would touch at.\n",
      "But she was immovable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every one concluded me her humble servant, and were touched at the\n",
      "moving interview; the young ladies, and their female attendants,\n",
      "especially. With great difficulty, upon my solemn assurances of honour,\n",
      "she trusted herself with me in one of the cabins; and there I tried,\n",
      "what I could, to prevail upon her to quit her purpose; but all in\n",
      "vain: She said, I had made her quite unhappy by this interview! She had\n",
      "difficulties enough upon her mind before; but now I had embittered all\n",
      "her voyage, and given her the deepest distress.\n",

      "I could prevail upon her but for one favour, and that with the greatest\n",
      "reluctance; which was, to accept of the five hundred pounds, as a\n",
      "present from me; and she promised, at my earnest desire, to draw upon\n",
      "me for a greater sum, as a person that had her effects in my hands, when\n",
      "she arrived, if she should find it convenient for her. In short, this\n",
      "was all the favour I could procure; for she would not promise so much as\n",
      "to correspond with me, and was determined on going: and, I believe, if\n",
      "I would have married her, which yet I had not in my head, she would not\n",
      "have deviated from her purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how, sir, said I, did you part? I would have sailed with her,\n",
      "answered he, and been landed at the first port in England or Ireland,\n",
      "I cared not which, they should put in at; but she was too full of\n",
      "apprehensions to admit it; And the rough fellow of a master, captain\n",
      "they called him, (but, in my mind, I could have thrown him overboard,)\n",
      "would not stay a moment, the wind and tide being quite fair; and was\n",
      "very urgent with me to go a-shore, or to go the voyage; and being\n",
      "impetuous in my temper, (spoiled, you know, my dear, by my mother,) and\n",
      "not used to control, I thought it very strange that wind or tide, or any\n",
      "thing else, should be preferred to me and my money: But so it was; I was\n",
      "forced to go; and so took leave of the ladies, and the other passengers;\n",
      "wished them a good voyage; gave five guineas among the ship's crew, to\n",
      "be good to the ladies, and took such a leave as you may better imagine\n",
      "than I express. She recommended once more to me, the dear guest, as\n",
      "she called her, the ladies being present; and thanked me for all these\n",
      "instances of my regard, which, she said, would leave a strong impression\n",
      "on her mind; and, at parting, she threw her arms about my neck, and\n",
      "we took such a leave, as affected every one present, men, as well as\n",
      "ladies.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, with a truly heavy heart, I went down the ship's side to my boat;\n",
      "and stood up in it, looking at her, as long as I could see her, and she\n",
      "at me, with her handkerchief at her eyes; and then I gazed at the ship,\n",
      "till, and after I had landed, as long as I could discern the least\n",
      "appearance of it; for she was under sail, in a manner, when I left her;\n",
      "and so I returned highly disturbed to my inn.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to bed, but rested not; returned to London the next morning; and\n",
      "set out that afternoon again for the country. And so much, my dear, for\n",
      "poor Sally Godfrey.--She sends, I understand, by all opportunities,\n",
      "with the knowledge of her husband, to learn how her child, by her first\n",
      "husband, does; and has the satisfaction to know she is happily provided\n",
      "for. And, about half a year ago, her spouse sent a little negro boy, of\n",
      "about ten years old, as a present, to wait upon her. But he was taken\n",
      "ill of the small-pox, and died in a month after he was landed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, sir, said I, your generous mind must have been long affected with\n",

      "\n",
      "It hung upon me, indeed, some time, said he; but I was full of spirit\n",
      "and inconsideration. I went soon after to travel; a hundred new objects\n",
      "danced before my eyes, and kept reflection from me. And, you see, I had\n",
      "five or six years afterwards, and even before that, so thoroughly lost\n",
      "all the impressions you talk of, that I doubted not to make my Pamela\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, my dear, said he, and I bless God for it too!--I do most\n",
      "sincerely!--And 'tis my greater pleasure, because I have, as I hoped,\n",
      "seen my error so early; and that with such a stock of youth and health\n",
      "on my side, in all appearance, I can truly abhor my past liberties, and\n",
      "pity poor Sally Godfrey, from the same motives that I admire my Pamela's\n",
      "virtues; and resolve to make myself as worthy of them as possible: And\n",
      "I will hope, my dear, your prayers for my pardon, and my perseverance,\n",

      "These agreeable reflections, on this melancholy but instructive story,\n",

      "Yesterday we set out, attended by John, Abraham, Benjamin, and Isaac, in\n",
      "fine new liveries, in the best chariot, which had been new cleaned, and\n",
      "lined, and new harnessed; so that it looked like a quite new one. But\n",
      "I had no arms to quarter with my dear lord and master's; though he\n",
      "jocularly, upon my taking notice of my obscurity, said, that he had a\n",
      "good mind to have the olive-branch, which would allude to his hopes,\n",
      "quartered for mine. I was dressed in the suit I mentioned, of white\n",
      "flowered with silver, and a rich head-dress, and the diamond necklace,\n",
      "ear-rings, etc. I also mentioned before: And my dear sir, in a fine\n",
      "laced silk waistcoat, of blue paduasoy, and his coat a pearl-coloured\n",
      "fine cloth, with gold buttons and button-holes, and lined with white\n",
      "silk; and he looked charmingly indeed. I said, I was too fine, and would\n",
      "have laid aside some of the jewels; but he said, It would be thought\n",
      "a slight to me from him, as his wife; and though as I apprehended,\n",
      "it might be, that people would talk as it was, yet he had rather they\n",
      "should say any thing, than that I was not put upon an equal footing, as\n",
      "his wife, with any lady he might have married.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems the neighbouring gentry had expected us; and there was a great\n",
      "congregation; for (against my wish) we were a little of the latest; so\n",
      "that, as we walked up the church to his seat, we had abundance of gazers\n",
      "and whisperers: But my dear master behaved with so intrepid an air, and\n",
      "was so cheerful and complaisant to me, that he did credit to his kind\n",
      "choice, instead of shewing as if he was ashamed of it: And as I was\n",
      "resolved to busy my mind entirely with the duties of the day, my\n",
      "intentness on that occasion, and my thankfulness to God, for his\n",
      "unspeakable mercies to me, so took up my thoughts, that I was much\n",
      "less concerned, than I should otherwise have been, at the gazings and\n",
      "whisperings of the ladies and gentlemen, as well as of the rest of the\n",
      "congregation, whose eyes were all turned to our seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the sermon was ended, we staid the longer, because the church\n",
      "should be pretty empty; but we found great numbers at the church-doors,\n",
      "and in the church-porch; and I had the pleasure of hearing many\n",
      "commendations, as well of my person, as my dress and behaviour, and not\n",
      "one reflection, or mark of disrespect. Mr. Martin, who is single, Mr.\n",
      "Chambers, Mr. Arthur, and Mr. Brooks, with their families, were all\n",
      "there: And the four gentlemen came up to us, before we went into the\n",
      "chariot, and, in a very kind and respectful manner, complimented us\n",
      "both: and Mrs. Arthur and Mrs. Brooks were so kind as to wish me joy;\n",
      "and Mrs. Brooks said, You sent Mr. Brooks, madam, home t'other day,\n",
      "quite charmed with a manner, which, you have convinced a thousand\n",
      "persons this day, is natural to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "You do me great honour, madam, replied I. Such a good lady's approbation\n",
      "must make me too sensible of my happiness. My dear master handed me into\n",
      "the chariot, and stood talking with Sir Thomas Atkyns, at the door\n",
      "of it, (who was making him abundance of compliments, and is a very\n",
      "ceremonious gentleman, a little too extreme in that way,) and, I\n",
      "believe, to familiarize me to the gazers, which concerned me a little;\n",
      "for I was dashed to hear the praises of the countrypeople, and to\n",
      "see how they crowded about the chariot. Several poor people begged\n",
      "my charity, and I beckoned John with my fan, and said, Divide in\n",
      "the further church-porch, that money to the poor, and let them come\n",
      "to-morrow morning to me, and I will give them something more, if they\n",
      "don't importune me now. So I gave him all the silver I had, which\n",
      "happened to be between twenty and thirty shillings; and this drew away\n",
      "from me their clamorous prayers for charity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Martin came up to me on the other side of the chariot, and leaned on\n",
      "the very door, while my master was talking to Sir Thomas, from whom he\n",
      "could not get away; and said, By all that's good, you have charmed the\n",
      "whole congregation! Not a soul but is full of your praises! My neighbour\n",
      "knew, better than any body could tell him, how to choose for himself.\n",
      "Why, said he, the dean himself looked more upon you than his book.\n",
      "\n",
      "O sir, said I, you are very encouraging to a weak mind! I vow, said\n",
      "he, I say no more than is truth: I'd marry to-morrow, if I was sure\n",
      "of meeting with a person of but one-half the merit you have. You are,\n",
      "continued he, and 'tis not my way to praise too much, an ornament to\n",
      "your sex, an honour to your spouse, and a credit to religion.--Every\n",
      "body is saying so, added he; for you have, by your piety, edified the\n",
      "whole church.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he had done speaking, the dean himself complimented me, that\n",
      "the behaviour of so worthy a lady, would be very edifying to his\n",
      "congregation, and encouraging to himself. Sir, said I, you are very\n",
      "kind: I hope I shall not behave unworthy of the good instructions I\n",
      "shall have the pleasure to receive from so worthy a divine. He bowed,\n",
      "and went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Thomas then applied to me, my master stepping into the chariot, and\n",
      "said, I beg pardon, madam, for detaining your good spouse from you: but\n",
      "I have been saying, he is the happiest man in the world. I bowed to him,\n",
      "but I could have wished him further, to make me sit so in the notice of\n",
      "every one; which, for all I could do, dashed me not a little. Mr. Martin\n",
      "said to my master, If you'll come to church every Sunday with your\n",
      "charming lady, I will never absent myself, and she'll give a good\n",
      "example to all the neighbourhood. O, my dear sir! said I to my master,\n",
      "you know not how much I am obliged to good Mr. Martin! He has, by his\n",
      "kind expressions, made me dare to look up with pleasure and gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said my master, My dear love, I am very much obliged, as well as you, to\n",
      "my good friend Mr. Martin. And he said to him, We will constantly go\n",
      "to church, and to every other place, where we can have the pleasure of\n",
      "seeing Mr. Martin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Martin said, Gad, sir, you are a happy man; and I think your lady's\n",
      "example has made you more polite and handsome too, than I ever knew you\n",
      "before, though we never thought you unpolite, neither. And so he bowed,\n",
      "and went to his own chariot; and, as we drove away, the people kindly\n",
      "blessed us, and called us a charming pair.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I have no other pride, I hope, in repeating these things, than in\n",
      "the countenance the general approbation gives to my dear master, for his\n",
      "stooping so low, you will excuse me for it, I know.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the afternoon we went again to church, and a little early, at my\n",
      "request; but the church was quite full, and soon after even crowded; so\n",
      "much does novelty (the more's the pity!) attract the eyes of mankind.\n",
      "Mr. Martin came in after us, and made up to our seat; and said, If you\n",
      "please, my dear friend, I will take my seat with you this afternoon.\n",
      "With all my heart, said my master. I was sorry for it; but was\n",
      "resolved my duty should not be made second to bashfulness, or any other\n",
      "consideration; and when divine service began, I withdrew to the farther\n",
      "end of the pew, and left the gentlemen in the front, and they behaved\n",
      "quite suitably, both of them, to the occasion. I mention this the\n",
      "rather, because Mr. Martin was not very noted for coming to church, or\n",
      "attention when there, before.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dean preached again, which he was not used to do, out of compliment\n",
      "to us; and an excellent sermon he made on the relative duties of\n",
      "Christianity: And it took my particular attention; for he made many\n",
      "fine observations on the subject. Mr. Martin addressed himself twice or\n",
      "thrice to me, during the sermon; but he saw me so wholly engrossed with\n",
      "hearkening to the good preacher, that he forbore interrupting me; yet I\n",
      "took care, according to the lessons formerly given me, to observe to\n",
      "him a cheerful and obliging behaviour, as one of Mr. B----'s friends and\n",
      "intimates. My master asked him to give him his company to supper; and he\n",
      "said, I am so taken with your lady, that you must not give me too much\n",
      "encouragement; for I shall be always with you, if you do. He was pleased\n",
      "to say, You cannot favour us with too much of your company; and as I\n",
      "have left you in the lurch in your single state, I think you will do\n",
      "well to oblige us as much as you can; and who knows but my happiness may\n",
      "reform another rake? Who knows? said Mr. Martin: Why, I know; for I am\n",
      "more than half reformed already.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the chariot door, Mrs. Arthur, Mrs. Brooks, and Mrs. Chambers, were\n",
      "brought to me, by their respective spouses; and presently the witty Lady\n",
      "Towers, who bantered me before, (as I once told you,) joined them; and\n",
      "Mrs. Arthur said, she wished me joy; and that all the good ladies, my\n",
      "neighbours, would collect themselves together, and make me a visit.\n",
      "This, said I, will be an honour, madam, that I can never enough\n",
      "acknowledge. It will be very kind so to countenance a person who will\n",
      "always study to deserve your favour, by the most respectful behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Towers said, My dear neighbour, you want no countenance; your own\n",
      "merit is sufficient. I had a slight cold, that kept me at home in the\n",
      "morning; but I heard you so much talked of, and praised, that I resolved\n",
      "not to stay away in the afternoon; and I join in the joy every one gives\n",
      "you. She turned to my master, and said, You are a sly thief, as I always\n",
      "thought you. Where have you stolen this lady? And now, how barbarous is\n",
      "it, thus unawares, in a manner, to bring her here upon us, to mortify\n",
      "and eclipse us all?--You are very kind, madam, said he, that you and all\n",
      "my worthy neighbours see with my eyes. But had I not known she had so\n",
      "much excellency of mind and behaviour, as would strike every body in her\n",
      "favour at first sight, I should not have dared to class her with such of\n",
      "my worthy neighbours, as now so kindly congratulate us both.\n",
      "\n",
      "I own, said she, softly, I was one of your censurers; but I never liked\n",
      "you so well in my life, as for this action, now I see how capable your\n",
      "bride is of giving distinction to any condition.--And, coming to me, My\n",
      "dear neighbour, said she, excuse me for having but in my thought, the\n",
      "remembrance that I have seen you formerly, when, by your sweet air and\n",
      "easy deportment, you so much surpass us all, and give credit to your\n",
      "present happy condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear good madam, said I, how shall I suitably return my acknowledgments!\n",
      "But it will never be a pain to me to look back upon my former days,\n",
      "now I have the kind allowance and example of so many worthy ladies to\n",
      "support me in the honours to which the most generous of men has raised\n",
      "me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sweetly said! she was pleased to say. If I was in another place, I would\n",
      "kiss you for that answer. Oh! happy, happy Mr. B----! said she to my\n",
      "master; what reputation have you not brought upon your judgment! I\n",
      "won't be long before I see you, added she, I'll assure you, if I come by\n",
      "myself. That shall be your own fault, madam, said Mrs. Brooks.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so they took leave; and I gave my hand to my dear master, and said,\n",
      "How happy have you made me, generous sir!--And the dean, who had just\n",
      "come up, heard me, and said, And how happy you have made your spouse,\n",
      "I'll venture to pronounce, is hard to say, from what I observe of you\n",
      "both. I courtesied, and blushed, not thinking any body heard me. And my\n",
      "master telling him he should be glad of the honour of a visit from him;\n",
      "he said, He would pay his respects to us the first opportunity, and\n",
      "bring his wife and daughter to attend me. I said, That was doubly kind;\n",
      "and I should be very proud of cultivating so worthy an acquaintance. I\n",
      "thanked him for his kind discourse; and he thanked me for my attention,\n",
      "which he called exemplary: and so my dear master handed me into the\n",
      "chariot; and we were carried home, both happy, and both pleased, thank\n",
      "God.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Martin came in the evening, with another gentleman, his friend, one\n",
      "Mr. Dormer; and he entertained us with the favourable opinion, he said,\n",
      "every one had of me, and of the choice my good benefactor had made.\n",
      "\n",
      "This morning the poor came, according to my invitation; and I sent them\n",
      "away with glad hearts to the number of twenty-five. There were not above\n",
      "twelve or fourteen on Sunday, that John divided the silver among, which\n",
      "I gave him for that purpose; but others got hold of the matter, and made\n",
      "up to the above number.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "My generous master has given me, this morning, a most considerate, but\n",
      "yet, from the nature of it, melancholy instance of his great regard for\n",
      "my unworthiness, which I never could have wished, hoped for, or even\n",
      "thought of.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took a walk with me, after breakfast, into the garden; and a little\n",
      "shower falling, he led me, for shelter, into the little summer-house,\n",
      "in the private garden, where he formerly gave me apprehensions; and,\n",
      "sitting down by me, he said, I have now finished all that lies on my\n",
      "mind, my dear, and am very easy: For have you not wondered, that I have\n",
      "so much employed myself in my library? Been so much at home, and yet not\n",
      "in your company?--No, sir, said I; I have never been so impertinent as\n",
      "to wonder at any thing you please to employ yourself about; nor would\n",
      "give way to a curiosity that should be troublesome to you: And, besides,\n",
      "I know your large possessions; and the method you take of looking\n",
      "yourself into your affairs, must needs take up so much of your time,\n",
      "that I ought to be very careful how I intrude upon you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, said he, but I'll tell you what has been my last work I have taken\n",
      "it into my consideration, that, at present, my line is almost extinct;\n",
      "and that the chief part of my maternal estate, in case I die without\n",
      "issue, will go to another line, and great part of my personal will fall\n",
      "into such hands, as I shall not care my Pamela should be at the\n",
      "mercy of. I have, therefore, as human life is uncertain, made such a\n",
      "disposition of my affairs, as will make you absolutely independent and\n",
      "happy; as will secure to you the power of doing a great deal of good,\n",
      "and living as a person ought to do, who is my relict; and shall put\n",
      "it out of any body's power to molest your father and mother, in the\n",
      "provision I design them, for the remainder of their days: And I have\n",
      "finished all this very morning, except to naming trustees for you; and\n",
      "if you have any body you would confide in more than another, I would\n",
      "have you speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so touched with this mournful instance of his excessive goodness\n",
      "to me, and the thoughts necessarily flowing from the solemn occasion,\n",
      "that I was unable to speak; and at last relieved my mind by a violent\n",
      "fit of weeping; and could only say, clasping my arms around the dear\n",
      "generous man, How shall I support this! So very cruel, yet so very kind!\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't, my dear, said he, be concerned at what gives me pleasure. I am\n",
      "not the nearer my end, for having made this disposition; but I think\n",
      "the putting off these material points, when so many accidents every day\n",
      "happen, and life is so precarious, is one of the most inexcusable things\n",
      "in the world. And there are many important points to be thought of, when\n",
      "life is drawing to its utmost verge; and the mind may be so agitated\n",
      "and unfit, that it is a most sad thing to put off, to that time, any of\n",
      "those concerns, which more especially require a considerate and composed\n",
